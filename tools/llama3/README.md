# Llama3 Weight conversion tool
This directory contains the scripts to convert the Llama3 checkpoints from HuggingFace to Nanotron and vice versa.

- Convert from HuggingFace to Nanotron

`torchrun --nproc-per-node 1 tools/llama3/convert_hf_to_nanotron.py --nanotron-checkpoint-path nanotron_checkpoints/Nanotron-Llama-3-8B --pretrained-model-name-or-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`
- Convert from Nanotron to HuggingFace

`torchrun --nproc-per-node 1 tools/llama3/convert_nanotron_to_hf.py --nanotron-checkpoint-path nanotron_checkpoints/Nanotron-Llama3-8B --hugging-face-checkpoint-path hf_checkpoints/Converted-Nanotron-Llama-3-8B`

In summary, we will do the following:
- Initialize the HuggingFace model with the pretrained weights. The model definition is [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/modeling_llama.py).
- Initialize a Nanotron model with empty weights. The model definition is [here](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron/blob/main/src/nanotron/models/llama.py).
- Copy the parameters layer by layer from one model to the other.
- Store the Nanotron model along with the tokenizer.

When comparing the HuggingFace implementation with the Nanotron implementation, the main difference lies in the Q, K & V matrices and in the MLP projections. In the HuggingFace implementation, these matrices are separated [[1]](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/modeling_llama.py#L415), [[2]](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/1518508467d96b3866fc4ebcb7a5b3a2e0df2aa4/src/transformers/models/llama/modeling_llama.py#L194), while in the Nanotron implementation, they are concatenated [[1b]](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron/blob/b69690703a1c41b60cd706f92a80a3d23ebaf2d0/src/nanotron/models/llama.py#L310), [[2b]](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron/blob/b69690703a1c41b60cd706f92a80a3d23ebaf2d0/src/nanotron/models/llama.py#L149). It is crucial to pay attention to these details to convert the models correctly.

To perform the conversion, we will need at least **1 GPU**, although the operations will be carried out on the **CPU**. We will convert the models with a parallel configuration of DP = PP = TP = 1, but it should be noted that the checkpoints generated by Nanotron are topology agnostic.
