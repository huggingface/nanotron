# Troubleshooting Guide
Description: Common issues and solutions for Nanotron development. Apply when debugging performance, memory, or training problems.

## Memory Issues

- Check tensor dimensions and data types
- Review gradient accumulation settings
- Validate activation checkpointing settings
- Monitor CUDA memory fragmentation

## Performance Problems

- Examine communication patterns between processes
- Check for CPU bottlenecks in data loading
- Review batch size and gradient accumulation settings
- Analyze profiler traces for unexpected synchronizations or idle time

## Training Instability

- Check learning rate and warmup settings
- Validate weight initialization approaches
- Review normalization layers and activation functions

## Profiling

Enable profiler in config:
```python
profiler=ProfilerArgs(profiler_export_path="./tb_logs")
```

Or in YAML:
```yaml
profiler:
  profiler_export_path: "./tb_logs"
```
