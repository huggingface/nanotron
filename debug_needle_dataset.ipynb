The chapter also presents how mothers perceive the situation of their children. More children than women live at this shelter. Almost all the children are victims of violence. Most were born in Sweden, but several have mothers or fathers who were born in another country. Some of the children are subjected to honour-related violence, with threats of kidnapping. No systematic violence and security assessment at which the children can make their voices heard is ordinarily conducted at the shelter. Half of the school-age children did not attend school for several months and received home schooling only to a very limited extent. Many of the younger children did not attend preschool. Resilience can be promoted for children in the life at a shelter also by volunteers.\\nAarhus: Aarhus Universitetsforlag , 2015.<s> German government to step in on Vattenfall sale\\nA document has emerged, indicating Germany\\'s intention to persuade Swedish utility Vattenfall not to sell its lignite power plant portfolio.\\nReuters reports that the leaked internal position paper shows that Germany\\'s economy and energy minister Sigmar Gabriel, is due to fly to Stockholm to discuss the sale of the company\\'s lignite coal-fired power plants, although no date for the talks was disclosed.\\nChancellor Merkel\\'s deputy is to argue that \"A breakup of this group as well as excessive price expectations would endanger the security of employment and the sustainability of the operating units,\" according to the document.\\n\"I am sure that the Swedish government and Stefan Lofven are aware of their responsibilities,\" he said.\\nLast month, Vattenfall\\'s new chief executive Magnus Hall said the company might put its lignite power plants and mines in Germany up for sale. This could fetch up to 3 billion euros, according to people familiar with the industry.\\nVattenfall generates about 10 per cent of Germany\\'s total power production and said it remains committed to other operations in Germany, including heat production, trading and wind power.\\nPrevious articleTablets maximising use of on-site renewables\\nNext articleJordanian solar plants secure $100m in finance<s> The Clojurians Slack [sign up here] started as a small experiment about four years ago and has been far more successful than anyone could have imagined, with around 15K members signed up and around 1,700 members considered \"active\" on a weekly basis (which means it would cost almost $9K per month to run this as a paid service!).\\nA perennial complaint about Slack\\'s free plan is that it limits the accessible message history to just the most recent 10K messages. In a busy Slack like Clojurians that limit is hit after three or four days, heavily limiting the ability to refer back to conversations or to use the massive amount of \"knowledge\" shared there for reference – exactly as noted in the comment above.\\nThe \"original\" online Clojure community still exists and is still active on IRC (freenode), of course, and there\\'s also Braid (written in Clojure/ClojureScript!).\\nI was a bit surprised that the commenter did not mention Clojurians on Zulip because that community, started back in early November 2018, already has five hundred members and seems, to me, like the most capable alternative to Slack. It\\'s open source, hosted for free to open source communities, and \"has a significantly larger and more active development community than other modern open source group chat solutions like Mattermost, Rocket.Chat, and matrix.org.\" Read their Why Zulip? page for more information about the service and how it compares (specifically to Slack).\\nOne-way bridging between select Slack channels and Zulip streams has been in place for a while and currently about fifty of the most popular channels on Slack are available to read in Zulip streams, along with many other active streams in Zulip. This means you can try Zulip without missing out on Slack conversations – some people prefer Zulip\\'s UI just for reading Slack messages!\\nClojurians on Slack isn\\'t going away – a lot of people love the UI and don\\'t consider the message history limit to be a big deal – and if you\\'re already using Slack for work, then it makes perfect sense to also use that for your Clojure community fix (since you only need one chat client open). The Slack community isn\\'t \"official\" in any way, and you\\'re all welcome to try other chat clients, but if you feel strongly about open source and unlimited search history, check out Clojurians on Zulip and if you like it, promote it and encourage other Clojurians to join you there.\\nMe? I\\'m one of the long-time admins/moderators of Clojurians on Slack, but I\\'ve also tried each and every one of the alternatives that various community members have set up over the last four years. Clojurians on Zulip is the one I\\'ve found myself most active in and the only alternative chat client that I always have open at this point!<s> As part of NYCHA\\'s Sandy Resiliency and Renewal Program, TCT is providing cost estimating services for the Basis of Design Study and Schematic Design of resiliency projects at three sites: Coney Island Site 8, O\\'Dwyer Gardens, and Surfside Gardens.\\nConey Island Site 8 consists of one residential building with 124 apartment units.

However, much remains unknown about the effectiveness of games to learn specific subject matter. The aim of this study was to better understand the role that games can play in learning physics. In this study, we examine what participants learned by playing Physicus-a commercial, edutainment game. Physicus seeks to teach students basic physical science concepts (related to electricity and magnetism, and light and color) by embedding these ideas in a \"save the world\" scenario. Results of our study indicate that participants, who played Physicus, did learn physics concepts compared to the control group who played a non-edutainment game. We discuss how these learning gains interacted with participants\\' motivation, enjoyment, and interest for physics and games.\\nFoster, A., Koehler, M. & Mishra, P. (2006).

Fellows work two summer internships at the Gates Foundation as part of a partnership between Hertz and the philanthropic juggernaut.\\nA round of six new fellows was announced last month after an inaugural cohort of two students in 2017. The fellowship is intended to provide students in STEM with hands-on experience in global health issues, and to inspire them to engage with such challenges. It\\'s a unique educational opportunity, but also related to a trend in science philanthropy of putting researchers from varied disciplines into new contexts, or otherwise combining different areas of study, to encourage innovative crossovers.\\nThe Hertz-Gates Fellowship in Global Health and Development is a supplemental program to the Hertz Foundation\\'s graduate fellowship, which has been running for more than 60 years. Fellows receive full tuition and a personal stipend, renewable for up to five years, and must be studying applied physical and biological sciences, mathematics or engineering at a list of participating universities.\\nTo date, there have been around 1,200 fellows, and they\\'ve gone on to secure thousands of patents and win major awards like the Breakthrough and two Nobel prizes. Hertz fellows can now apply for the Hertz-Gates Fellowship, which adds on stints at the Gates Foundation working for program teams in global health or development.\\nThe Hertz Foundation\\'s sole purpose is to support science education, and its fellowship targets one of the most challenging periods in a young researcher\\'s career. The foundation has been around since 1957, when it was established with a very 1950s-sounding intent to \"enhance the technological stature of the United States.\" It\\'s based in the wealth of John Hertz, who led a pretty fascinating life and career with various automotive companies (he founded Yellow Cab), but is probably best known for Hertz rental cars.\\nAnd you might be familiar with the Gates Foundation. While such a partnership between two foundations makes sense regardless, this does underscore just how prominent Gates is in the world of global health.\\nIt\\'s primarily an educational fellowship, but one of the more interesting components of the partnership is that mashup of many disciplines and global health work. Funder interest in introducing science researchers to a new setting is particularly relevant in biomedical and health research, and as scientists explore new applications of data and computer science. We\\'ve covered this kind of funding in the Simons Foundation\\'s Flatiron Institute, for example, which brings computer scientists, physicists and biologists under one roof. Most recently, the Wellcome Trust\\'s LEAP program seeks to back risky research, including that which crosses disciplines.<s> Lots of movies reviewed this week including War Dogs, Purge Election Year, and Mechanic Resurrection.

Hij leverde belangrijke bijdragen aan de statistiek, de abstracte algebra, de wiskundige analyse en in het bijzonder aan de getaltheorie. Hij was een van de toonaangevende Franse wiskundigen aan het einde van de 18e en begin van de 19e eeuw, die een bloeiperiode was voor de Franse wiskunde. Hij is een van de 72 Fransen wier namen in reliëf op de Eiffeltoren zijn aangebracht.\\n\\nLegendre was een tijdgenoot van Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Sadi Carnot en Gaspard Monge in de rumoerige period van de Franse Revolutie. Laplace, Lagrange en Legendre hebben zich volledig afzijdig gehouden van de revolutie.\\n\\nLegendre is bekend gebleven om zijn didactische verbetering in de behandeling van de elementaire meetkunde. Van 1775 tot 1780 was hij docent aan de Militaire Academie, later aan de École Normal en tot slot de École polytechnique, alle in Parijs. Het grootste deel van zijn werk werd geperfectioneerd door anderen: zijn werk aangaande wortels van veeltermen inspireerde de galoistheorie. Niels Henrik Abel bouwde in zijn werk over elliptische functies voort op het werk van Legendre. Ook Carl Friedrich Gauss maakte bij sommige van zijn resultaten op het gebied van de statistiek en de getaltheorie gebruik van het werk van Legendre.\\n\\nIn 1830 gaf hij een bewijs van de laatste stelling van Fermat voor de exponent , een bewijs dat bijna gelijktijdig door Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet werd gegeven in 1828. Hij had eerder het foute bewijs van Leonhard Euler voor  verbeterd.\\n\\nIn de getaltheorie leverde Legendre belangrijke bijdragen, in het bijzonder tot de toepassing van de analyse op de getaltheorie. Zijn vermoeden uit 1796, voor wat nu de priemgetalstelling wordt genoemd, werd pas honderd jaar later, in 1898, door Hadamard en Charles-Jean de La Vallée Poussin bewezen. Het legendre-symbool is een andere bijdrage van hem op dit gebied.\\n\\nLegendre verrichtte een indrukwekkende hoeveelheid werk met betrekking tot elliptische functies, waaronder de classificatie van elliptische integralen.\\n\\nDe naar hem genoemde legendre-transformatie wordt in de theoretische mechanica gebruikt om dat lagrangiaanse formalisme over te zetten in het hamiltonformalisme. In de thermodynamica wordt het ook gebruikt om thermodynamische potentialen vrije energie (ofwel helmholtzenergie)  en de gibbsenergie  af te leiden uit de inwendige energie .\\n\\nDifferentiaalvergelijking van Legendre \\nIn 1784 vond hij de oplossing van de differentiaalvergelijking\\n\\nDe oplossing staat bekend also de legendre-polynoom\\n\\nEnkele stellingen van Legendre \\n  en  zijn geen van beide rationaal.\\n Het aantal priemgetallen tussen 1 en  is ongeveer gelijk aan .\\n\\nHet vermoeden van Legendre \\n\\nVoor elk positief geheel getal  geldt dat er tussen  en  minstens een priemgetal ligt.\\n\\nPortret \\nVan Legendre is geen portret bekend. Lange tijd werden artikelen en boeken over Legendre geïllustreerd met een portret van een man, gezien van opzij. Pas in 2005 werd ontdekt dat deze litho de Franse politicus Louis Legendre (1752–1797) voorstelt, en niet de wiskundige.

Here are the two key passages that pertain to what you are simply not allowed to put in your app:\\n5.1 Your app must not contain adult content, and metadata must be appropriate for everyone\\nApps with a rating over PEGI 16, ESRB MATURE, or that contain content that would warrant such a rating, are not allowed. Metadata and other content you submit to accompany your app may contain only content that would merit a rating of PEGI 12, ESRB EVERYONE, or Windows Store 12+, or lower.\\nOh, and if you were hoping to somehow dodge this, Microsoft has thought of that already:\\n6.2 Your app must have a Windows age rating, and you must submit third-party ratings for your app if you have them\\nYou must assign a Windows Store age rating that most accurately matches your app. The Age rating page contains more detailed descriptions of the content that is suitable for each Windows Store age rating.\\nThis is not a small issue. As PC Gamer reported earlier today:\\n[T]his [set of rules] not be such a problem in the US, where relatively few games receive a mature rating, but it will be very significant in Europe, where games such as Dishonored, Skyrim, Sleeping Dogs, Assassin\\'s Creed, Call of Duty all fall foul of the restriction.\\nSomeone call Notch, he may have been right.\\nWhat made Windows great, akin to the Internet, was its openness. Now however, for a large swath of coming Windows devices – tablets running Windows RT, in which you can only snag applications via the Windows Store – that openness is over.\\nBetween you and app content on your device sits Microsoft, deciding what is fit for you to see, and what isn\\'t. This isn\\'t a free speech issue; Microsoft is free to design its products and run its services as it may, but that doesn\\'t do away with the fact that this sort of censorship is ridiculous, and unneeded.\\nHow can we know that? Simple: We\\'ve prospered and survived without it thus far, so we hardly require it. I honestly feel sorry for gamers in regions that have ratings systems that befall Redmond\\'s red lines; sorry brosef, Ballmer doesn\\'t think you should be able to play that.\\nNaturally, you could buy a tablet that runs Windows 8 proper, and have no such problems, but if Microsoft is going to push a version of Windows for the mobile use case that intends on playing nanny with your ability to execute normal tasks – like the playing of a popular, mainstream game – then something has gone wrong.\\nWhat about Apple?\\nCertainly, Apple has strict rules in terms of what sort of content you can put into its App Store. Again, that\\'s its prerogative. iOS, a very popular platform, has been locked down since its inception. When the iPhone launched – calling all builds of iPhone software iOS is loose wording, I know, but bear with me – iOS supported no third-party applications. Things have improved, but not completely.\\nThat\\'s the kicker to all of this, and why the Apple comparison is only slightly cogent: Windows is moving from complete and utter openness, to being partially closed, whilst Apple has moved from being completely to partially closed. Thus we can bemoan the decline of Windows and not fret too much about giving Apple a free pass.\\nWhat should be done?\\nMicrosoft should let adults use any damn app they want, provided that it is legal. No one is telling Microsoft to not censor child pornography. However, its blanket bans, which lean on rating systems of what I would call dubious efficacy, are asinine. Adults should be free to submit, and download any sort of app they wish.\\nChildren can be restricted to age appropriate applications until they come of age, at the behest of their parents.\\nSimple, easy, and it reopens Windows to being the platform, once again, where developers are as free as users to do as they please. We\\'re not kids, Microsoft, and we don\\'t want your false protection.\\nTop Image Credit: Michael Coté\\nRead next: Tumblr launches Photoset: An iOS-only photo sharing app that could help it lure in new users\\nMediaTek\\'s 2021 flagship chip comes with big promises: 168Hz display and ray tracing<s> Cactus Club Café: Stephen Avenue\\nAssembledge+ has continued its ongoing collaboration with Cactus Restaurant Group in support of the Vancouver-based company\\'s expansion into Canada\\'s western provinces.\\nLocated in the dense commercial core of downtown Calgary, Stephen Avenue is a historic pedestrian mall providing an eclectic mix of boutiques and high-end retail.

Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos announced that the company will start giving its consumers the option of end-to-end encryption in its Mail service by next year.\\nGoogle showed off a PGP-based encryption plugin for Gmail back in June. The Purple-hued company will offer encryption via a modified version of the same End-to-End browser plug-in that Google uses for PGP in Gmail, Alex Stamos told the audience at his talk titled Building Safe Systems at Scale - Lessons from Six Months at Yahoo.\\nThe PGP plugin will be native in mobile apps allowing Gmail and Yahoo mail to easily exchange encrypted email. In fact, the email providers themselves won\\'t be able to decrypt messages exchanged between its users. Only senders and recipients will be able to read the messages.\\nIn short, it means that Yahoo email users can reportedly send safe and secure messages between Yahoo users and also Gmail adherents without fear, which makes almost impossible for cyber criminals and well-resourced spying by the US government and its Five Eyes allies to read their private messages.\\nStamos (@alexstamos) said that this project has been a priority since he joined one of the world\\'s largest web providers, Yahoo six months ago. He stressed that Yahoo email encryption will be easy to use, with little or no efforts.\\nThe announcement was tweeted by Yan Zhu, who has reportedly been hired to assist in the project. Yan Zhu formerly worked as an engineer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit organization that has consistently been outspoken in its call for the widespread use of encryption across the Web and the Internet, and he is apparently no friend of the NSA.\\nBut as said earlier, use of encryption will require some amount of education for users also, to make sure their privacy expectations are set appropriately. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Stamos explained that PGP encryption won\\'t cloak the destination of your e-mail.\\n\"We have to make it clear to people it is not [a] secret you\\'re emailing your priest, but the content of what you\\'re e-mailing him is secret,\" Stamos said.\\nThe move to encrypted mail will bring Yahoo! in the list of the most secure technology companies in mail services among web giants, Google and Microsoft that protect their customers in the post-Snowden era of security.<s> AntiRSI.xcodeproj 674 2 years Nicholas Riley Upgrade for vaguely modern Xcode (7.2.1).\\nEnglish.lproj 677 2 years Nicholas Riley MainMenu?.nib: Update for current-ish Xcode.\\nAntiRSI.h 3.9 KB \\u200b 371 11 years Nicholas Riley AntiRSI.h: Updated for 1.4njr4; forgot a place last time.\\nAntiRSI.m 25.7 KB \\u200b 675 2 years Nicholas Riley AntiRSI.m: Fix format string issue and compilation on >10.4.\\nAntiRSIView.m 2.4 KB \\u200b 346 11 years Nicholas Riley Updated for 1.4njr3.

In December 2014, she attended a talk by MCW-Central Wisconsin Dean Lisa Grill Dodson, MD, and hearing about the local accelerated medical school program immediately piqued her interest. In the four years since she first learned of the program, Anna transferred to UW-Madison to complete her pre-med undergraduate studies, applied to MCW-Central Wisconsin and was accepted as a member of this year\\'s incoming class.\\n\"I have been interested in a career in medicine ever since high school and am particularly interested in working in primary care and community medicine in more rural areas,\" she says. \"When I first learned the opportunity to attend medical school in my own hometown was becoming available, I knew right away I wanted to be involved.\"\\nAnna has deep ties with the Wausau community. She grew up volunteering at the county jail and her church, and she was a bell ringer for the Salvation Army each year around the holidays. Throughout her high school years, she tutored her peers, worked in the greenhouse and as a lifeguard at the community pools, and played violin at the hospice house.\\n\"I have seen a lot of different aspects of Wausau,\" Anna says. \"There\\'s so much going on here for a town of 40,000 people. It\\'s a very engaging place to live.\"\\nAnna first became interested in medicine when she shadowed physicians in clinics in Wausau for a high school class. She also completed a family medicine clinical internship in a local clinic, which she says influenced her decision to become a community physician.\\n\"I became interested in the field because I saw how collaborative, dynamic and challenging it was to practice community medicine,\" Anna says. \"I liked how connected those doctors were to their community and how they knew how to meet local needs. I knew right away that community medicine appealed to me.\"\\nAfter attending Dr. Dodson\\'s talk in 2014, Anna joined a pipeline committee for the campus as a student representative to encourage high school and college students in central Wisconsin to explore careers in medicine. Each month, she met with Dr. Dodson, local physicians and advisors and staff from local colleges to help promote student engagement and awareness for the new program.\\n\"The pipeline committee provided resources and information about practicing medicine that students in central Wisconsin otherwise might not have found,\" Anna says. \"I wanted to be a strong asset for faculty and staff at MCW and a good liaison to local students.\"\\nAnna says the connection between her interests in the medical field and her strong ties to her local community was the reason she was invested in letting other students know about the new campus.\\n\"There is a problem in central Wisconsin with retaining medical students who will want to stay here and practice as primary care physicians,\" she says. \"From my point of view, I\\'m hopeful having a medical school in central Wisconsin will develop physicians who are deeply invested in this community and want to stay. I grew up here and am familiar with this area, which makes practicing patient care here that much more personal. MCW was my top choice for medical school, and I became a member of the pipeline committee because I wanted others to know about this opportunity as well.\"\\nMCW-Central Wisconsin is one of two regional campuses MCW created as a solution to Wisconsin\\'s physician shortage, which studies indicate severely limit patient access to quality care in more rural areas of the state. One report by the Wisconsin Hospital Association estimated that by 2030, Wisconsin could experience an estimated shortfall of 2,000 physicians. MCW expects to lower the cost of medical education and increase the number of medical students who stay to practice in rural areas through their campuses in both Wausau and Green Bay and the establishment of new residency programs. Ultimately, leaders across MCW\\'s three campuses hope educating students across the state will result in a physician workforce with a deep understanding of local health care needs and better patient outcomes. Anna says she has already seen firsthand the impact MCW-Central Wisconsin has had on the central Wisconsin community.\\n\"The campus is great for students, but it is also a great thing for this community. I have seen how receptive people in Wausau are to MCW,\" she notes. \"People love that we have this great institution here now, and we\\'re proud our community can support this.

While having individual savings accounts is important, there is also need to create a joint account in which the couple can contribute and save accordingly.\\nInvest in Health Insurance: Securing health concerns must be the top most priority for newly married couples. This means that partners must share details about any pre-existing diseases they might have suffered in the past. Accordingly they can choose a health insurance. In addition, if they are planning to start a family in near future, they must focus on investing in a health insurance that covers pregnancy or has maternity insurance features. Since all insurance companies do not provide maternity coverage, it is important that couples read details shared in the proposal form before zeroing in on their choice of policy. It is important to note that most health insurers agree to pay for maternity expenses only two years of paying premiums for the health insurance plan. It is important that couples invest in health insurance with maternity coverage two years before planning to have a baby.\\nBuy Insurance for Long-Term Security: Marriage entails responsibility. Financial security is another big factor that affects choice of investments and quantum of savings. To ensure that your partner continues to enjoy the same kind of lifestyle throughout life, you may start investing in a term plan that would pass on the sum insured to your partner in case of your sudden demise. Alternatively, you may invest in various life insurance plans that would not only earn you returns after some years or pay the sum insured to your nominee, i.e., your partner.\\nInsurance to Meet Medical Expenses: Some couples may look for insurance only to meet hospitalisation expenses realising that they can afford to pay pre and post-hospitalisation charges. Such couples can choose to pay for mediclaim policies that would pay for the insured\\'s hospitalisation subject to the condition that he or she has remained admitted to hospital for more than 24 hours.\\nBe Clear About Your Financial Priorities: This is important without which you cannot set financial goals. The husband may want to start a business of his own after he turns 40 years, while the wife may more inclined to travel around the world and save money for the same. Keeping in mind both their financial goals, the couple must make investments that would not only secure their future, but fulfill their goals too. Though risky investments yield better returns than most others, it would be prudent to invest in less-risky investments giving handsome returns. This would not only help the couple earn good returns, but lend them a feeling of security too.\\nSummary: Individual financial goals are different from a couple\\'s financial goals. Therefore, decisions regarding investments and insurance must be made keeping their needs in mind.<s> I wanna go to Gram and Pap\\'s for a swim!

Seth Berry on school consolidation. Mr. Webster has given his statement as to why the school consolidation law should be repealed. You can read Mr. Webster\\'s full statement after the cut.\\nThe consolidation law should be repealed. A \"yes\" vote on Question #3 will restore fairness to the organization of school systems in Maine. Mandated consolidation does not work for rural areas. People throughout Maine should recognize and honor the votes of over 200 communities that rejected consolidation. Large school systems will not meet the needs of eastern and northern Maine.\\nThe consolidation law has been inconsistently applied and sometimes unfairly interpreted and implemented by the Commissioner of Education.\\n• Maine laws since 1897 have always included a method for towns not well served by a school district or school union to withdraw. As interpreted by the Commissioner in 2007 and 2008 consolidation plans were not allowed to include withdrawal provisions in the proposed consolidation plans – even though the consolidation law was silent on this matter. Yet in 2009 the town of Allagash was allowed to include a withdrawal provision in its consolidation plan with Ft. Kent.\\n• Schools systems exempt from consolidation (those with 2,500 or more students and the off shore islands) were required to submit plans to the Dept. of Education on how savings would be found in administration, special education and transportation. Exempt schools filed these plans. NONE of the exempt schools were required to implement any of those savings plans.\\n• School systems with 1,200 up to 2,500 students were among the school systems required to create and vote on consolidation plans. School units of this size that voted down their plans were let off the \"penalty\" hook by the Commissioner. No penalties were imposed for these \"middle size\" districts. School systems with fewer than 1,200 students will suffer subsidy penalties in July of 2010.\\n• The Commissioner rejected consolidation plans that did not find savings. Consolidation planning committees were told to list savings even if there were none. The Blue Hill-Deer Isle area consolidation plan was rejected twice by DOE and only approved on a third attempt after \"savings\" were included for subsidy that would be lost due to the subsidy penalty built into the law. Some communities that voted to consolidate felt \"bullied\" into it.\\nA \"yes\" vote on Question #3 will restore our liberty and freedom. Maine citizens should be able to organize local schools in ways that make sense to us – without the threat of financial coercion from our own Dept. of Education. Repeal will re-establish the local authority of Maine towns and cities to organize local schools in the best interests of our own children. The consolidation law curtailed our freedom. Repeal will restore our freedom.\\nFiled under: Uncategorized | Tagged: Blue Hill, education, maine, Public Education, Question 3, School District Consolidation, Seth Berry, Yes On 3 |\\n« Women\\'s and Children\\'s Groups Support No on 1 Yes On 3 Statement from Skip Greenlaw »<s> A Soft Bucket can do all kinds of things, like keep plants cosy, desks tidy and bread rolls warm.

In this case, $\\\\vec{n}=\\\\pm\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\left<1,1,1\\\\right>$. We notice that $\\\\nabla\\\\times\\\\left<y,z,x \\\\right>=-\\\\left<1,1,1\\\\right>$ and $\\\\nabla\\\\times\\\\left<y,z,x \\\\right>\\\\cdot\\\\vec{n}=\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{3}$ then $$\\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\pm\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\iint_SdS=\\\\pm\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}A(S)=\\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\pi a^2}{\\\\sqrt{3}}.$$\\nNotes: the direction of the contour $\\\\gamma$ was not specified. It will affect the sign of the the integral, hence we have $\\\\pm$ in the final answer. $A(S)=\\\\pi a^2$ denotes the area of the circle that lies in the intersection of the sphere and the plane. Since the plane passes through the center of the sphere, we know that its radius is $a$.\\nThis is the most straightforward solution, however if you insist on parametrization we can be more adventurous. Our goal in the this case is to parametrize the curve $\\\\gamma:$ $$\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ccr}x+y+z&=&0\\\\\\\\x^2+y^2+z^2&=&a^2\\\\\\\\\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$$ Let\\'s take a look at the first equation: $0=x+y+z=\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{z}{2}\\\\right)+\\\\left(y+\\\\frac{z}{2}\\\\right)=u+v$, where $u$ and $v$ are the expressions in the princesses. The first equation transforms into $u+v=0$ (much better). For the equation of the sphere we will get $$a^2=x^2+y^2+z^2=\\\\left(u-\\\\frac{z}{2}\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(v-\\\\frac{z}{2}\\\\right)^2+z^2=u^2+v^2-z(u+v)+\\\\frac{3}{2}z^2$$ We remember that $u+v=0$ and our system is reduced to: $$\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ccr}u+v&=&0\\\\\\\\2u^2+\\\\frac{3}{2}z^2&=&a^2\\\\\\\\\\\\end{array}\\\\right.,\\\\hskip{30pt} \\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{ccr}u+v&=&0\\\\\\\\\\\\frac{u^2}{a^2/2}+\\\\frac{z^2}{2/3a^2}&=&1\\\\\\\\\\\\end{array}\\\\right. $$\\nNow we apply the standard parameter for an ellipse $$\\\\begin{array}{rcl}u&=&\\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\cos t\\\\\\\\z&=&\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}a\\\\sin t\\\\\\\\v&=&-u\\\\\\\\\\\\end{array}$$ We should not  forget to bring these equation to the original system of coordinates $$\\\\begin{array}{rcl}x(t)&=&u-\\\\frac{1}{2}z=\\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\cos t-\\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{6}}\\\\sin t, \\\\\\\\y(t)&=&v-\\\\frac{1}{2}z=-\\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\cos t-\\\\frac{a}{\\\\sqrt{6}}\\\\sin t, \\\\\\\\z(t)&=&\\\\frac{2a}{\\\\sqrt{6}}\\\\sin t,\\\\end{array}$$ where $0\\\\le t \\\\le2\\\\pi$. For sake of completeness let us compute the form $ydx+zdy+xdz$ in terms of the parameter $t$. We keep thorough track of the terms $\\\\sin^2t$ and $\\\\cos^2t$ and we don\\'t care much about the terms of the form $\\\\sin t\\\\cos t$ since the integration of the mixed terms over $[0,2\\\\pi]$ will result in $0$: $$ydx+zdy+xdz=\\\\left[C\\\\sin t\\\\cos t-\\\\frac{a^2}{\\\\sqrt{12}}+\\\\frac{2a^2}{\\\\sqrt{12}}\\\\right]dt=\\\\frac{C}{2}\\\\sin2tdt+\\\\frac{a^2}{2\\\\sqrt{3}}dt,$$ where $C$ is an irrelevant constant. After integrating from $0$ to $2\\\\pi$ the first term disappears due to the periodicity and we arrive to $$\\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\frac{a^2}{2\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\cdot 2\\\\pi=\\\\frac{\\\\pi a^2}{\\\\sqrt{3}},$$ which confirms our earlier computation.\\nHere again the contour direction was not specified. The change of direction will result in the integration from $2\\\\pi$ to $0$ which will reverse the sign of the integral if necessary.\\n<s> Call it the Washout in Windsor.\\nIf the National Basketball League of Canada had a higher profile, Thursday\\'s washout would be right up there with the 1987 Punchup in Piestany or the 1976 walkoff when the Moscow Red Army left the ice against the Philadelphia Flyers.\\nIn no way can the NBL flatter itself that it\\'s that important.\\nIt will have to settle for being remembered as the league that opted to die by suicide in a very public manner.\\nThursday was supposed to be Game 7 in the NBL final between the defending champion Windsor Express and Halifax Rainmen. Instead it turned into yet another black eye for a league that saw the Rainmen leave the WFCU Centre because they feared for their safety.\\n\"Due to a physical altercation between the Halifax Rainmen and the Windsor Express the game has been cancelled citing safety concerns for its players and coaches,\" Rainmen owner Andre Levingston said. \"When the game is not safe for players to compete there is a problem. We have to do a better job of governing our league and putting principles in place where there are strict consequences.\\nIt began when the Rainmen arrived for a morning shootaround at what they thought was an empty WFCU Centre.\\nReports indicate that the Express were in the building but that their scheduled shootaround time had not yet arrived.\\nThere was a physical confrontation between Express coach Bill Jones and Rainmen forward Liam McMorrow when McMorrow wouldn\\'t give Jones a basketball.\\nBoth teams then got into it and threats were allegedly made.\\nNo doubt the fight could have been avoided by giving the misbehaving individuals a timeout in the corner and making them miss recess.\\nInstead, Vito Frijia owner of the London Lightning and a member of the league executive committee left from London to see if he could straighten out the issue. Also in Windsor was Brampton A\\'s coach David Magley.\\nAs Frijia was heading to Windsor, he managed to stop the Rainmen bus that was heading to the airport on the highway in the other direction.\\n\"I made them pull over and I talked to them about an hour trying to sort things out but they were worried about their safety,\" said Frijia who when he initially heard about the fight extra security earlier in the day.\\nFrijia said early in the evening that the game was not forfeited.\\n\"We are going to have a conference call (Saturday) morning and see what\\'s going to happen,\" he said.\\nHe said Magley would be one of the key figures investigating the situation.\\nYet several hours later there were reports that the game was forfeited and Windsor were league champs.\\nIt all makes the league an even bigger joke.\\nFrijia said that the biggest issue is that many of the players, especially on the Rainmen team, already have contracts to begin play in other leagues next week.\\nIt\\'s a nightmare for Frijia and the NBL. This is a league that among other things announced a television contract that didn\\'t exist and that has had three commissioners in four years. The last commissioner Paul Riley announced he was leaving the position on twitter only to have the league try to one-up him an hour later by saying he was fired.\\nThe idea that a Game 7 to decide a championship wasn\\'t played because of safety concerns stemming from a punch-up in a morning shootaround will no doubt add to the belief that the NBL is the Wild West with the only thing missing the shootout at the OK Corral.\\nGive it time though. If the league continues to operate without independent supervision, the OK Corral will seem like a spitball fight compared to what might happen.\\nThe reality is that not even a stick of dynamite shoved in some of these owners\\' nether regions enough of a wake up call to turn them into professionals.\\nWith Thursday\\'s circus, they\\'ve truly earned the moniker National Bush League of Canada.<s> COUSIN-Special multi-level ends easily create perfect wire loops and jump rings!

He talks about its development here.\\nGrenadier – has moved a step closer with news that it will be powered by BMW engines.\\nBoth petrol and diesel units will be provided by the German marque and the Grenadier is due to go on sale in mid-2021.\\nPrecise details of which engines from BMW will be used have yet to be confirmed, but it\\'s likely the Grenadier will use the 252bhp 2.0-litre turbo petrol and 261bhp 3.0-litre turbo diesel from the X5 range.\\nHowever, the team behind the Ineos-backed car say it is not a collection of other companies\\' parts but a coherent model that BMW has accounted for in its development programme. This means the Grenadier will use the latest BMW powerplants rather than previous generation motors.\\nThe Projekt Grenadier will not come with an electric option for the foreseeable future as Ratcliffe believes it adds too much weight and complexity for what he wants to achieve.\\nThe Grenadier aims to be a replacement for the Land Rover Defender that went out of production at the end of 2015. Ratcliffe says this has left a gap in the market for a truly utilitarian 4x4 that is not an SUV.\\nHe says he wants to put the \"utility back into 4x4s\" and the new car will be narrower than most rivals such as the Toyota Hilux and Jeep Wrangler. He added the Grenadier will have its wheels as close to the corners of the vehicle as possible for the best off-road ability.\\nWhile the Grenadier has moved away from the first idea as that looked like an older Land Rover, the simple approach to design has remained at the core of the car.\\nIt will feature flat glass that\\'s cheaper to make and replace if it\\'s broken, as well as a pared-back interior with rubber mats and seats that can be hosed clean.\\nRatcliffe added: \"It might sound arrogant to think we can fill the gap left by the Defender, but we have the confidence.\\nIneos Automotive believes it can sell up to 30,000 Grenadiers each year, with many being used in places such as Africa and Australia.\\nThe company is currently looking for a factory site in the UK where it can assemble the Grenadier using its own chassis with aluminium bodywork offered in a variety of styles to suit the needs of different users. Ratcliffe expects the Grenadier to cost from £30,000 when it goes on sale.<s> August 14, 1972-- Bridgeview Disaster Narrowly Averted\\nChicago Tribune photo\\nAugust 14, 1972 – During the evening rush hour, the temperature in the Chicago area drops quickly from 94 degrees to 71 as winds from the west at over 60 miles-per-hour kick up. As the dark storm clouds move quickly toward the city, 800 people in Bridgeview are gathered in a circus tent, watching the elephant act of the Rudi Brothers Circus. Fortunately, officials at the site spot the storm moving toward them, and order the tent cleared before winds topple four 50-foot poles onto the empty bleachers, covering the area with torn and twisted canvas. Bernard Mendelson, one of the managers of the circus, says, \"When you\\'ve been around a circus as long as I have, you develop a sixth sense about these things. I told [my partner] Rudy, \\'Get those people out now, right now.\\'\" [Chicago Tribune, August 15, 1972] The ringmaster, Charles Cox, is alerted and announces, \"Ladies and gentlemen there\\'s a little wind blowing up. Would you please leave the tent by the front entrance because the elephants will be going out the other way. Please walk, don\\'t run.\" As people file out, the musicians continue to play as the tent begins to shudder in the wind. Circus performers spend most of the night, clearing the debris so that the circus, sponsored by the Confederation of Police as a fund-raiser for drug abuse information programs and a legal defense fund for its members, can go on the following day in an improvised setting.\\nAugust 14, 1960 – The Chicago Daily Tribune reports that a building at 739 North State Street has been raised, and the rubble is made up of the remains of the flower shop that Dion O\\'Banion ran, a place \"where murders, boot-legging, and hi-jackings were planned amidst flowering plants and the scent of roses.\" [Chicago Daily Tribune, August 14, 1960] Ironically, at the time \"the same building that once served as the headquarters of a bloody band of killers during the guzzling decade of the twentieth century\" was most recently used as a meeting place for the Young People\\'s club of Holy Name Cathedral. In April of 2017 it was disclosed that JDL Development had agreed to pay $110 million to the Archdiocese of Chicago for the 90,000 square-foot property three blocks west of North Michigan Avenue. On January 18, 2018 the Chicago Plan Commission approved a project to build two towers on the site, the taller of which will be the eighth Chicago \"supertall\" building at 1,011 feet. The killing of Dion O\\'Banion in the shop in 1924 touched off a gang war that lasted for five years, pitting the North Side gang of O\\'Banion against Al Capone\\'s gang from the South Side. The black and white photo shows the flower shop. The second photo shows the future of the site -- it will hold the sixth tallest building in the city, One Chicago Square.\\nAugust 14, 1936 –Nathan Goldblatt signs a contract for the purchase of the residence built by Benjamin Marshall in Wilmette on Sheridan Road opposite the Baha\\'i Temple. It is reported that Marshall, the architect who designed the Drake Hotel, the South Shore Country Club and the Blackstone Theater and a host of other impressive buildings, had reportedly spent over a million dollars on the home and its furnishings. The Spanish-influenced home commanded a view of Lake Michigan … the Sheridan Shores Yacht Club used the home\\'s basement as its clubhouse. Marshall\\'s work studio had a space for 45 draftsmen. The home had a 50-foot-high, 75-by-100-foot tropical garden with palm and banana trees. The home\\'s swimming pool was lined with turquoise tiles from Algiers. Goldblatt reportedly paid $60,000 for the home but did not stay there long, and in 1950 Wilmette had the home razed. Only the wrought-iron gates remain on the property, which is today owned by the Baha\\'i Temple.\\nAugust 14, 1933 – Joseph Hastings, a Chicago policeman married for only four months, is shot to death during a gun battle with two thieves who rob a city office on Navy Pier. He is the eleventh policeman to die in the line of duty during 1933. The money that is stolen was intended for men on emergency relief who were employed by the city to do work at the pier. Thomas B. Rawls, an official of the West Englewood Currency exchange, used it to cash checks from the workers at a fee of 15 cents a check. It is unclear why a representative of a private enterprise is cashing checks in an office of the city street department. Hastings, hearing a shot fired, runs into a second floor office at the west end of the pier. One of the dozen clerks in the office, Charles Eddy, outlines the ensuing events, \"Hastings came in the door with his revolver drawn . . . The man at the side wall opened fire. The policeman fell to the floor and fired two shots in return. The robbers ran to the door. Hastings got up, and one of the robbers turned and shot him as he rose. The robber then grabbed Hastings\\' gun and ran out. . .\" [Chicago Daily Tribune, August 13, 1933] Morris Cohen a barber, is captured 30 minutes later at 1331 North Clark Street. His two companions remain on the lam. The above photo depicts Navy Pier as it appeared in 1933.\\nPosted by Chicago Old and New at 12:30 AM\\nLabels: 1972, Chicago Event, Weather Events\\nAugust 31, 1902 -- Lake Michigan Melee\\nAugust 30, 1937 -- Lake Shore Drive in Lincoln Par...\\nAugust 29, 2013 -- Wolf Point West Gets Go-Ahead f...\\nAugust 28, 1929 -- Graf Zeppelin Gives Chicago a Show\\nAugust 27, 1939 -- Peoples Gas Building Loses Its ...\\nAugust 26, 1920 -- Children\\'s Memorial Hospital Be...\\nAugust 25, 1900 -- Coliseum Dedicated\\nAugust 24, 1966 -- John Hancock Center Stops Work\\nAugust 23, 1985 -- Navy Pier\\'s Slow Disintegration...\\nAugust 22, 1982 -- Wabash Avenue Strip Joint Busted\\nAugust 21, 1982 -- East Delaware Place Hotel Conve...\\nAugust 20, 1990 -- Standard Oil Sheds Its Carrara ...\\nAugust 19, 1926 -- Chicago River Bridges Slammed b...\\nAugust 18, 1904 -- Lake Bluff Protests Navy Propos...\\nAugust 17, 1978 -- Michigan Avenue German Consulat...\\nAugust 16, 1978 -- Loop Elevated Should Go ...

Under the pretense of having appraised the value of the property, however, the process is heavily weighted in favor of the government and against the landowner. When the process starts, the landowner loses title immediately and is forced to fight an uphill battle to try either to prevent the taking or to exact fair compensation for his property or his business.\\nOur lawyers have decades of experience in contesting condemnation actions by all level of government agencies of Georgia. Whether at the state, county, city, or utility level, we are skilled in contesting the valuations presented by the government. Our lawyers have developed some of the key decisions in the area of eminent domain in Georgia. They have represented the interest of both the landowner and commercial tenants. For landowners, they have protected the interests by forcing the government to clearly state the extent of the interest being taken, which has often resulted in increased awards at trial. For commercial tenants, they have developed strategies for identifying and proving damages and losses suffered by businesses in property affected by condemnation.\\nOur experience and willingness to forcefully litigate condemnation cases through trial has given us the advantage of better settlements where possible. Absent pre-trial resolution, our lawyers will skillfully maneuver the defenses and arguments presented by the government and its appraisers to bring the landowner or the tenant the best possible outcome.\\nOur lawyers have presented seminars to attorneys on eminent domain procedures and current events in the area of practice for over 28 years.\\nChallenged the description of an easement for the removal of \"danger trees\" in a condemnation petition, resulting in a later date of taking of the property and therefore a higher property value.\\nChallenged the description of a \"temporary work easement\" in a case where a commercial building had to be removed because of the project, resulting in the condemning authority\\'s payment of additional funds for square footage contained in the easement, a new date of taking and therefore a higher value on the whole parcel.\\nSuccessfully tried a business loss claim of over $2,000,000 before a jury on behalf of a commercial tenant against the Department of Transportation\\'s argument that the business was worthless, resulting in a 100% recovery of the tenant\\'s losses.\\nContested the DOT\\'s argument that property presently being used as residential could not be valued as commercial property, resulting in a valuation of over 250% more than what was presented by the government.\\nRepresented a commercial landowner of a corner property on a heavily traveled state road against two separate takings, the first by the county and the second by the DOT, showing that the county was aware of the planned subsequent talking by the DOT and that the county\\'s taking would eliminate access from the most visible and valuable part of the property.\\nLitigated the loss of a tract of property with an ongoing business on it to a settlement representing all of the landowner\\'s appraisal and 90% of the interest that would have been recovered at trial if the jury result had been to accept the landowner\\'s appraisal.\\nChallenged the taking of portions of an aging shopping center on behalf of a commercially successful business, forcing the recovery of a substantial settlement beneficial to the tenant.\\nNegotiated a change in the planned construction of a road, preserving a business owner\\'s access to the property by either a right or left turn in and out.\\nIncreased the award over the condemning authority\\'s testimony of value at the Special Master\\'s level of an office building in Midtown Atlanta and thereafter successfully negotiated a settlement for an additional $1.5 million and an advantageous lease in the property pending the commencement of construction and use by the condemnor.<s> Join us every Saturday afternoon from 2 to 4 for a journey into rare and novel teas with Kevin, Fly Awake\\'s senior wizard.

Also, can you walk us through your two touchdowns?\\nDA: The third-and-18 play, basically I think I had a little bit of an option route in the middle of the field and I saw that there was room. I had pointed out the line [to gain] before the play snap so I knew where to get to and Tom [Brady] had a laser and it was perfect. The two touchdowns: the first one, the go-ahead touchdown. It\\' s a play we\\'ve worked on – I scored on it a couple of times this year, I think, actually. I have a crosser in the back of the end zone and Tom reads the first whip route on the left to \\'Cookie\\' [Brandon Cooks] and then if he doesn\\'t have it then his eyes come to me in the back. We had it and it was a zone coverage. I obviously didn\\'t see what happened to Cookie on the first read and then Tommy had a great ball. I knew it was coming right by that \\'backer or safety in the back. It was a great throw.\\nQ: Your Patriots career was off to a relatively slow start. How does it feel to get to the point where you\\'re the No. 1 guy in the AFC Championship Game?\\nDA: I\\'m thankful for my opportunity here and what it\\'s been the last five years. I have a lot of great memories here. Any negative thing or anything that\\'s tried to hinder me, I try to ignore and focus on the positive things that have been going on in this building for the last five years for me. I\\'ve tried to build off that and be a good teammate and that\\'s the only thing I really focus on.\\nQ: It seemed like on your 20-yard punt return they kind of rushed the snap to get off a quick punt. Did that happen?\\nDA: I\\'m not sure. It was a quick snap. A lot of teams do that but I\\'m not sure what they were thinking. I believe we had a block on. We knew we were going to get pretty good field position. I think I was standing on the 40 or so and it was just about getting some yards.\\nQ: You had a lot of fair catches to that point…\\nDA: The punter was doing a great job all night of not out-kicking his coverage so to speak—kicking the ball high. I had my feet on the 10 a lot so I knew that he wasn\\'t going to kick it over my head and it was going to give him time to get down there. On that particular punt, I saw the rush. When you rush on a punt return, usually it holds the guys up even more. When they get out, they get scattered [and] they are not blocked. It just comes down to making a play when you get the ball in your hands, following a block or two or seeing any open space to get to. That was it.\\nQ: What did you notice from Tom Brady over the last week and everything that happened?\\nDA: Tommy\\'s the best. He\\'s the toughest guy I\\'ve ever met physically [and] mentally. If there is anything that happens to Tom, I know he can handle it. It was unfortunate to see him get injured mid-week. I know mentally it probably stressed him out a bit and physically I know it\\'s hard to throw a football with stitches in your thumb. Everybody knows how tough he is. Everybody knows that he\\'s our leader. It\\'s a testament to his career, his personality, the man he is. Not only is he the best player in our locker room but he gets everybody else to play well and step their game up and that\\'s why he\\'s the best.\\nQ: Do you feel any more internal pressure to step up when somebody like Rob Gronkowski comes out of the game?\\nDA: I don\\'t feel any added pressure, no. Every play I\\'m competing my tail off to try to win the route, win the block or whatever my job is on that play. Whoever is in the game, whoever is beside me, I have a lot of trust and faith in them whether it\\'s Gronk or Cookie or Hoagie [Chris Hogan]. Whoever it is, I know we have a lot of trust in this room.\\nQ: Can you talk about the Jaguars defense? They were playing so well, especially in the first half.\\nDA: Hats off to them. They played hard. We came out and we didn\\'t get many points on the board early. We made some adjustments at half. We wanted to come out and play faster, play more physical. We knew it was going to come down to the wire. They are a great team and they had a great season.\\nQ: When you heard that the double pass was called for you, did you get the sense it was \\'break open in case of emergency\\' or \\'all hands on deck\\'?\\nDA: We are trying to score. Whatever we\\'ve got to do. I don\\'t remember what happened on the flea-flicker. Who got the flea-flicker one? I don\\'t remember. [Phillip] Dorsett, that\\'s right. That\\'s a big play by Phil.

Houses in Vancouver West (west of Ontario Street), the most expensive real estate zone in B.C., are 28 per cent above the levels of five years ago, while adjacent areas such as East Vancouver and Richmond are almost as strong.\\nApartment markets are weaker across the board, according to current figures from the Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley real estate boards. In every market from Abbotsford to West Vancouver, detached homes have outperformed apartments over the past five years.\\nThe differences are often dramatic. Coquitlam has seen a 10 per cent increase in house prices over five years, and a 10.8 per cent decrease in apartment values; detached homes in South Surrey/White Rock are up 13.3 per cent in the same period, compared with a 16.8 per cent slide in apartment prices. Apartment prices on the east side of the City of Vancouver have risen slightly (3.5 per cent), but in this area house prices are up 23.6 per cent.\\nA modest general rally in apartment prices in February might be cause for hope for owners and sellers, but the fact is that markets have bounced around for years, generally in a downward direction.\\nLooking for the simplest explanations, it\\'s clear that apartment supply has grown substantially since 2008, especially at tower-dominated transit nodes such as Brentwood, downtown New Westminster and Coquitlam Central. And there is almost certainly less speculative money going into apartments: investor opportunities for windfall gains are less, the politics of strata management can be tiresome, and the leaky condo problem is still with us more than 25 years after it first emerged.\\nDespite the relative price weakness, developers continue to bring new supply on stream, presumably in expectation of a profit. There are apartment projects underway in most of the places we\\'ve visited in recent months — Metrotown, Austin Heights, White Rock, Burnaby Heights, uptown New West, and on and on. This makes sense, at least theoretically, in a world where older people are retiring and downsizing, and where younger people are looking for their first home purchase. The relative price stability of the apartment markets makes it possible to plan a down payment and the ensuing monthly payments with some confidence.\\nWriters on urban affairs assure us that many of today\\'s young people will be apartment dwellers for life, staying close to transit and walkable services rather than following their parents to the land of cul-de-sacs. Some even predict that the upper-end detached home in the middle and outer suburbs will become the real casualty in tomorrow\\'s real estate bubble. This trend may be taking hold already; it would be difficult to spot in price tables that report on large, diverse communities such as Coquitlam or Surrey.<s> On 1 to 3 June 2018, EisnerAmper United States hosted its annual Partner Conference for 2018 in Virginia, U.S.\\nThe event was attended by 200 Partners and was a great opportunity for EisnerAmper Global colleagues from the United States, Ireland, Cayman and Singapore to connect over a weekend of activities.\\nDiarmaid O\\'Keeffe, EisnerAmper Ireland, Ray Kelly, EisnerAmper Ireland, Ben Leung, EisnerAmper Cayman and Alastair MacDonald, EisnerAmper Ireland at the EisnerAmper US Partner Conference in Virginia.<s> Disease and Treatment\\nGhosts of My Lai, The\\nThe massacre of hundreds of civilians at My Lai was a turning point in the Vietnam War.\\nHMAS Sydney Memorial Service 2008\\nThe sinking of HMAS Sydney was the worst single loss ever suffered by the Australian navy, and the wreck of the ship was recently recovered off the coast of Western Australia.\\nQuantum - Radioactivity\\nIn a millisecond, on July 16, 1945, the evolution of the human species took a remarkable turn.\\nPart 1: A Deadly Dose\\nRadio Program Sales - Hindsight: Save Our Sons\\nIn the closing days of 1964, Prime Minister Robert Menzies introduced a bill in Parliament which would prove to be one of the most controversial and divisive decisions in Australia\\'s history.\\nSecrets of Stalingrad\\nIt changed the course of World War II - and the whole 20th Century.

It is one area which has a lot of potential. The Earth generates huge amounts of natural energy underground that basically needs to be utilized. As we approach our daily lives, we have no clue about the tremendous force that lies below our feet. All we must do is discover a way to take advantage of that energy for ourselves. The heart of the Earth is about sixty times hotter than boiling water. There is a lot of energy merely a few miles below the Earth\\'s surface that have already been created from the scorching heat generated from the Earth\\'s core.\\nIf you have ever watched what takes place when a volcano erupts, you will understand that there is much power and also energy in the magma, or superheated fluids. Some of these types of fluids come to the surface in the form of water vapor that is released in vents. Many people have created their very own vents and containment chambers to transform the magma into energy to power their households. A plant which could take advantage of this powerful resource needs to be built close to an area with a great source of heated fluid. Steam would be generated from the fluids that would be forced to the surface through the tubes that have been fitted down directly into the magma. An adequate amount of the steam would produce electricity, by turning a turbine engine.\\nNeedless to say, using geothermal energy on a massive scale does have a handful of controversy. Some critics believe that the cost of research and implementing is too costly and too time consuming. On top of that, the cost to build a plant is high with absolutely no guarantee that it could turn a profit. There is furthermore a chance that once a plant is completed, there might no longer be enough steam to generate electricity. There is also deep concern by environmentalists that toxins will also be brought up as well as the steam.\\nBut the advantages to utilizing geothermal energy significantly outweighs the criticisms. Further research should show that the energy would be provided by the Earth, so any toxins would be minimal. As soon as a geothermal plant is set up the work needed to channel the energy isn\\'t that great, making this type of energy very efficient.\\nThe natural environment would be disrupted less, because the plants are smaller compared to giant dams, atomic energy, or electrical facilities. With substantial use of geothermal energy, there would be less reliance on coal and oil for fuel.\\nWhat we realize for sure is that the price of geothermal is moving down and that the energy itself is an inexhaustible resource. While the initial upfront cost is still significant, once the capital is made back, it will be a very cheap source of energy. This really is a source of energy that will likely be in demand.<s> In 1900, mathematician and physicist Lord William Thomson Kelvin proclaimed, \"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now.

As Bloomberg reports, that\\'s the encouraging message coming from the US Department of Commerce, which is insisting that the framework was designed with political transition in mind. The Privacy Shield, which replaced the discredited Safe Harbor arrangements, is intended to place stronger obligations on US companies handing Europeans\\' personal data, limit US government access to such data and provide EU citizens affected by such issues with greater chance of redress. (See Eurobites: Privacy Shield Gets EU Go-Ahead.)\\nThe European Telecommunications Network Operators\\' Association (ETNO) has welcomed the European Parliament\\'s decision to allocate 700MHz spectrum to mobile broadband by 2020, believing that this is necessary for Europe to maintain a leading role in the development of 5G.

It\\'s not just for mentally disturbed people; everyone can benefit from it. It\\'s a proven method for self-improvement and performance.\\nIn hypnosis, positive changes can be made in your life, whether you want to lose weight, manage stress, or cure insomnia.\\nHypnosis occurs naturally in your brain when you\\'re relaxed, making it a very effective method. There is, however, a growing acceptance and recognition of the therapy. If you find yourself less focused and stressed, you can seek a help from hypnosis Illinois.\\n\"Hypnosis\" comes from the Greek word \"Hypnos,\" which means sleep. Hypnosis refers to a mental state in which a person becomes aware they are entering a different mental state.\\nHypnosis is a unique psychological and physiological condition that superficially resembles sleep but is characterized by the individual\\'s ability to operate at a level of consciousness different from the typical waking state.\\nThis condition is distinguished by enhanced receptiveness and responsiveness, where inner experience sensations have the same weight as outer experiences.\\nIt is a state of altered consciousness, where you can become more focused on the present and more open to suggestions. It\\'s used for many purposes, from treating physical ailments to improving your performance at work.\\nStages of Hypnosis:\\nThe four stages of hypnosis are induction, deepener, suggestions, and emergence.\\nDuring this stage, you start to relax, concentrate, and avoid distractions. Your hypnotherapist will guide you through this phase using controlled breathing and progressive muscle relaxation techniques.\\nDeepener\\nThis stage continues the last one, making it easier to relax and focus. This stage usually involves counting down or imagining yourself descending stairs. The first two steps aim to ease your receptivity to suggestions.\\nThis is the stage for genuine change in experience, behavior, or perception, as suggested. In addition to imagery, your hypnotherapist will select carefully chosen language to evoke your subconscious. Typically, the ideas are symptom-oriented (to alleviate a symptom) or exploratory (to investigate events associated with the onset of symptoms). There may be changes in emotion, perception, feeling, memory, thinking, or action.\\nYou emerge from hypnosis during this phase. Your hypnotist might use reverse deepeners, like making you think you\\'re going upstairs or counting.\\nCam Lucero can administer hypnotherapy safely. Hypnosis does not include mind control or brainwashing.

Wow. This is one ferocious beast of a garage psych record. One with raw, terrifying guitars that are equally at home with bludgeoning riffery, or spiralling -out-of-control guitar leads.

Sounding uncannily like Ty Segal at times, his is a game changing presence, with the sort of gifted melodicism that helped the likes of Kurt Cobain reach a level of universal connection that Mark Arm could never quite attain (for example). What I\\'m trying to say is that these are some seriously engaging vocal performances, especially when Hanson hits his falsetto.\\nI realise that I\\'ve painted a picture of a really noisy record here, and a lot of the time that is the case.

The recall has been issued for approximately 93,000 defective implants after it was found that the device was failing at a rate of 12%-15%. Due to this failure, many patients were requiring additional surgeries to revise the original hip replacement. The two implants being recalled are the ASR™ Acetabular Cup System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System. The DePuy ASR™ Acetabular Cup System is a metal-on-metal hip component used during a hip replacement surgery in the United States and worldwide. It was introduced in 2004. The ASR™ hip resurfacing system, which is used in a popular alternative to tradition hip replacement, has not been approved in the United States but has been used abroad.\\nManaging Partner of Hardison & Cochran, Ben Cochran, spoke briefly today about the filings. \"This is a dangerous product that should have never been marketed. It is subject to a high failure rate, and is likely to cause metal toxicity,\" said Cochran. \"In addition to this case being filed, we\\'re investigating many cases where a person\\'s well being suffered tremendously due to this product\\'s failure,\" he added.\\nFor a full look at the DePuy Hip Replacement Recall news covered on our blog, please click here\\nPhoto courtesey of Simon Davison by way of Flickr Creative Commons.\\nRequest for a Free\\nSend For A Free Consultation\\nHardison & Cochran serves North Carolina Communities\\nOver the years, we have represented thousands of clients and we very much enjoy learning about the things that are dear to them.

In bedding items with 100 or more customer reviews, there are 10 down and down-feather pillows, 6 featherbeds, and 8 comforters (for each of these items, there are many more with fewer reviews). Other down bedding articles sold on Amazon include down blankets and duvets. The greatest variety of manufacturers is in pillows, while down comforters are dominated by Egyptian Bedding, which has almost ⅔ the down comforters with over 100 customer reviews, collectively the highest number of reviews (Natural Comfort has the highest number of reviews for one item), and the highest average customer rating for several items (Snowman has the highest rating for one item).\\nTo put it bluntly, down and feathers come from either live or dead birds, shed or plucked.\\nEider ducks are the most productive live source of shed down. The mother duck sheds a large amount of down while preparing her nest for brooding, and she sheds more while brooding. With a tamed eider duck, extra down can be frequently harvested without harming or alarming the bird. Brood down is also collected from other domesticated waterfowl.\\nDown and feathers can be collected when birds molt in the spring and the fall. The advantage lies with domesticated birds, since the product is shed in controlled places and is cleaner and more secure than down collected in the wild.\\nIn ancient times and the Middle Ages, domestic fowl – both poultry and waterfowl – were raised for eggs and meat. Plucking a killed bird was part of the process of preparation for cooking, and the feathers and down were byproducts with their own value.\\nThis was true until modern large-scale farming with thousands of fowl raised together. Most of our eggs and chicken and turkey meat is now produced this way. The one drawback of this is that higher quality down is from waterfowl, but the milder-flavored meat from poultry is generally preferred over waterfowl, at least in North America. This limits the amount of waterfowl down which can be harvested without wasting carcasses.\\nIn some places, such as China, ducks and geese are raised primarily for meat. Duck and goose meat is more in demand in China and southeast Asia. Down and feathers are a significant and lucurative byproduct.\\nPlucking live birds used to be acceptable and common. It is no longer generally acceptable, and in many countries is also illegal. What is acceptable to the public is collection of shed down and feathers and plucking birds slaughtered for meat.\\nHowever, some farms in China pluck geese and ducks several times before butchering. The motivation for this is the demand for down by garment and bedding industries. The economic advantage of getting more down from a bird in its lifetime through several pluckings is that they are able to sell their down and feathers at a lower price for a larger market share. Some advocacy groups, such as PETA, have conducted undercover investigations.\\nAreas of concern in certification of down and feathers and products using them are (1) animal welfare, (2) sustainability, (3) organic aviculture, (4) hygiene, and (5) allergies. There are also labeling standards regulated by governments in Europe and North America concerning the ratio of down to feathers in a product.\\nFour organizations for the testing and certification of down and feather products, including bedding, are Responsible Down Standard (RDS), International Down and Feather Bureau (IDFB), American Down & Feather Council, and Allergy Standards Limited (ASL).\\nResponsible Down Standard (RDS) is an arm of the Textile Exchange (TE), a non-profit organizations whose members are firms engaged in textile industries. The concern of RDS is assuring consumers and manufacturers of down products that the down is procured in a manner not harmful to living birds. The part of the standard receiving the most public attention is the ban on live plucking.\\nOn their website, the International Down and Feather Bureau (IDFB) says, \"IDFB is the international trade association of the down/feather industry (processors of raw material and/or producers of finished articles, filled with down/feathers), the down/feather trade and independent testing institutes for down/feather as filling material.\" It is more narrowly focused than the Textile Exchange.\\nIDFB has 26 offices in 11 countries – most in China. This should not be surprising, since China is the largest producer of down and feathers.\\nThe American Down & Feather Council states on their site that they are \"a section of the Home Fashion Products Association (HFPA).\" Their concern is accurate labeling of down and feather products and the meeting of certain standards, including the humane treatment of the birds producing the down and feathers.\\nAllergy Standards Limited (ASL) was founded by healthcare professionals to set standards for allergens in consumer products and test the products for compliance with these standards. Certification by ASL means the products are free from allergens. This includes down and feather products.\\nRead \"Down and Feathers, Part 1\" here.<s> Boy George and Culture Club bring their iconic pop music show to the Washington State Fair on Sept. 13.

A very casual line of post-Santa questioning can lead kids to recognize how completely we all can snow ourselves if the enticements are attractive enough. Such a lesson, viewed from the top of the hill after exiting a belief system under their own power, can grid kids against the best efforts of the evangelists — and far better than secondhand knowledge could ever hope to do.—Dale McGowan from \"Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion\"\\nIt\\'s a good first step. This Christmas is going to be really awkward.\\nWhen you realize that your parents are human...\\nTwo years after my father passed away, a woman contacted me and said that she was my sister. Her mother was one of my father\\'s ex-girlfriends. So, for the last twenty years, we\\'ve thought that we were related. She called me about month ago. She did a DNA test and found her real biological father. She\\'s not my sister.\\nI was combing through the Black Friday ads and noticed that the kits were on sale for half the price. I ordered two of them. I was joking with my mother. I told her that I ordered them and asked if she had anything she wanted to tell me. Speak now or forever hold your peace. Ha-ha…not! She did. She said that her and my father weren\\'t married when she got pregnant with me. She was married to a man that drank a lot. They split up and he moved to Oklahoma. She started sleeping with my so-called my father, but her first husband came back to town for a visit, and they had sex around the same time. WTF?\\nMy brother is a year younger than me. I asked about him. She said that her and my father were just dating, and one night at a party, my father went off with one of her friends. She was pissed and so she slept with another guy. Small farming community. Video games weren\\'t invented yet. Not much to do, I suppose.\\nI was blown away. I have a cousin on my father\\'s side that looks like my twin. We\\'re really close. I called her and when she answered she said, \"Hey, Cuz!\" I started crying when she said that and then told her the whole story. Her parents recently passed away but she said that all of them have taken the tests. She sent off her parents DNA a month before her mother died. So, I should be able to find out if he is my father.\\nMy brother has really high standards. When it comes to morals, he\\'s like Syne on steroids. My mother asked me not to tell him. I didn\\'t make any promises. I called him and told him about what she said about me. He gave me this big lecture about how it\\'s always better to deal with the truth. \"The truth will set you free,\" he said. I asked, if it was him, would he want to know? \"Absolutely,\" he said. So, I told him. He freaked out. His tune completely changed when he found out that he was in the same boat. He was pissed, really pissed. He doesn\\'t want to know. He doesn\\'t even want to talk about it.\\nI did some research and the other guy is dead. He\\'s buried in a little town called Bunch, Oklahoma. I should be getting the results any day now. My father never knew that she slept with anyone else. He was my rock. My mother, not so much. She said that the only reason that he married her was because he loved me, and because of that, she\\'s always resented me. Yeah, this Christmas is going to be really awkward.\\nQuote: Dear Editor—I am 8 years old. Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Clause. Papa says, \"If you see it in the sun, it is so.\" Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Clause?\\nVirginia O\\'Hanlon\\nYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Clause. He exists as love, generosity, and devotion, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! How dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Clause? It would as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith, no poetry, and no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.\\nI hope he is. I hope that he\\'s my biological father.

But you just said you weren\\'t testing religion, and the reality of Santa isn\\'t in question.\\nWhat does that have to do with perceiving instead of acting? That example would seem to be the opposite of \"the enticements are[being] attractive enough\".\\nHowever, subsequent research has since failed to replicate findings supporting the backfire effect. One study conducted out of the Ohio State University and George Washington University studied 10,100 participants with 52 different issues expected to trigger a backfire effect. While the findings did conclude that individuals are reluctant to embrace facts that contradict their already held ideology, no cases of backfire were detected. The backfire effect has since been noted to be a rare phenomenon rather than a common occurrence (compare the boomerang effect).\\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmati...of_opinion\\nMore likely just motivated reasoning, which justifies belief to quell cognitive dissonance, rather than, itself, strengthening belief.\\nThis is \"a form of implicit emotion regulation in which the brain converges on judgments that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states associated with threat to or attainment of motives\". - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_...e_strategy\\nNow that sounds like an effort to make things seem more attractive rather than \"the enticements are[already being] attractive\".

TV Host Misses Having Shayna Taylor To \\'Lean On\\'\\nSource: MEGA\\nBy:Ribhu Singh\\nThe host with the most is desperate for another gig: committed boyfriend!\\nA source says that five months after Ryan Seacrest, 45, broke up with his food blogger girlfriend, Shayna Taylor, for the third time — after eight years of on-off dating — he wants back in.\\n\"He seemed so sure that breaking up was the right thing to do,\" says the source, \"but not having Shayna there to lean on and talk to has really gotten to him. He misses her so much.\"\\nBut the source insists Taylor, 28, is done playing second fiddle to the multitasking mogul\\'s breakneck schedule. \"She feels he still doesn\\'t appreciate how much she sacrificed four years ago to move to New York for him,\" explains the source. \"He\\'s promising to make more time for her, but Shayna\\'s not going to be messed with a fourth time.\"\\nSOCIAL DISTANCING FOR GOOD: CELEB COUPLES WHO\\'VE CALLED IT QUITS DURING QUARANTINE\\nApparently, Taylor isn\\'t the only one who\\'s done with being second best. As OK! previously reported, Seacrest\\'s Live With Kelly and Ryan co-host, Kelly Ripa, was \"pissed when she heard about his schedule,\" which saw the TV personality splitting time between Live and American Idol.\\nLast week, Seacrest took off from Live for two days — it was said that he had been under the weather and was getting tested for COVID-19 — but OK! learned that there may have been more behind his absence. The host seemed to be very busy with Idol, not to mention his radio show, and Ripa seemed less than pleased.\\n\"Ryan filmed American Idol over the weekend and filmed Monday and Tuesday for their national auditions that would not have interfered with Live With Kelly and Ryan,\" said the OK! source, adding that Ripa was frustrated that Live was not Seacrest\\'s top priority. \"There was no Idol when Ryan signed on to co-host. Kelly felt like it was just like her former co-host Michael Strahan, who would leave her for football every weekend, and then he took the Good Morning America job. Kelly was very clear with Ryan that she wanted someone who was fully committed to the show and was not going to waltz in and out for an hour each day.\"\\nARIEL WINTER, LEIGHTON MEESTER & MORE STARS SHINE ON ABC UPFRONTS RED CARPET\\nEven though Seacrest is an important part of the hit morning show, considering his name is on the bill, recent ratings revealed that he might not be as powerful as everyone once believed.\\nFollowing his two-day absence, a source exclusively told OK! that early overnight ratings for those Monday and Tuesday shows saw that Ripa flying solo proved to be a hit!\\n\"The assumption amongst a lot of the TV elite was that Ryan was the ratings machine behind Live With Kelly and Ryan. Since Ryan replaced Michael Strahan sitting next to Kelly each morning, that show has climbed to the top of the ratings, even beating Dr. Phil to the number one spot. However, with Ryan out sick and Kelly holding the fort down by herself,\" said the source, \"they didn\\'t lose any viewers.\"\\nIs There Trouble Brewing Between Alec & Hilaria Baldwin? \\'The Situation On The Homefront Is Becoming Unbearable,\\' Spills Insider\\n\\'We\\'ve Never Seen Someone So Polarizing\\': Ben Higgins Believes \\'There\\'s Something Off\\' About Victoria Larson\\'s Villain Persona\\nDid Country Star Garth Brooks Get Hair Plugs?

Dr. Keith P., P.C., B.Sc., M.D.\\nEsquimalt--Juan de Fuca (British Columbia)\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Martin_(physician)\\nhttp://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=c0377f5d-9a2b-4831-919c-8f5553270c2c&Language=E&Section=ALL\\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence (July 20, 2004 - February 5, 2006)\\nOctober 14, 2008 - March 26, 2011\\nMost Recent Speeches (Page 416 of 417)\\nMr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca)\\nMr. Speaker, if we are going to make conditions upon our humanitarian aid efforts then we had better be ready to back them up with some action.\\nAs I said before in my speech, my personal feeling on the matter is that if the stick we are going to use is the withdrawal of our humanitarian aid efforts, I disagree with that. We are obligated to continue with humanitarian aid efforts and not to do that would only involve an ever expanding war in the area with the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. I do not think we should use that suggestion as a stick. Rather we should use what leverage we have gained over the years to convince the other\\ncountries involved in this endeavour to side with us in strengthening the sanctions.\\nFor those countries that are not involved in the endeavour, we have trade and other agreements with them that we can use as a stick to make them do what we say in terms of stopping illegal export of arms, fuel and weapons to the warring side. There are alternatives that we need to use but I do not think we should use it as a stick in the UN.\\nSubtopic: Foreign Affairs\\nI understand, Mr. Speaker. I thank the member for a very intelligent question. It is a very far-reaching one.\\nThe world, in my estimation, is breaking up into tinier and tinier nation-states. Areas within countries are now defining themselves within the context of a certain ethnic group. That is tragic because they are not practising big T tolerance. That is what is occurring in the world today. We see it in many areas. We see it in Afghanistan, Cambodia. We see it in Bosnia and in fact in South Africa. It is going to happen time and time again.\\nOne of the lessons we have to learn through this is that we are going to be faced with these situations in the future time and time again as areas in countries start breaking down to the smallest sub-groups. We had better have a plan to deal with them.\\nAs I brought up in my speech, we have to get into these situations early and prophylactically. The United Nations did a very good job in Macedonia and has done a very good job in preventing the war from escalating there.\\nI hope we can collectively address the particular issue that the member mentioned because we are going to have to make a plan. We are going to be faced with it more and more in the future.\\nMr. Speaker, I think it would tell the rest of the world that our involvement in these conflicts, to some extent, would not be as much as we could have done.\\nAs I said before, if we remove ourselves from this conflict then the other member states that are engaging in the UN protective forces UNPROFOR are also going to move away from it and leave the people tragically to their own devices.\\nThe important point I would like to make, as I said before, is that the people we are talking to tend to be the leaders of the fighting groups and they do not necessarily represent the people on the ground. That is a very important point to remember. The people who are paying the price are the people on the ground, the innocent civilians. We are not talking to them. We are talking to the wrong people, in a sense.\\nAlthough the Canadian people and our armed forces have done an admirable job, and nobody can criticize them for the work that they did, even if they do pull out for whatever reason, I think it will be a personal tragedy. The other nation states that do follow us in this endeavour will also tragically pull out too.\\nMr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca)\\nMr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak today and to congratulate you on your ascension to the position of Deputy Speaker. I look forward to working with you. I also thank members of the government who have given all of us the opportunity to address this very important issue.\\nAs this is my maiden speech I would certainly like to take the opportunity to thank the people of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, my riding, for giving me their confidence on October 25. I commit to them that I will again do my very best to represent them here in Ottawa. This subject is of great importance to the people of my riding because of its long history in defence and peacekeeping with Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt being there and the Princess Patricia Rifles.\\nI would however like to say that because of the seriousness and gravity of the situation we are speaking about today, I will keep my introduction to the most beautiful riding in Canada to a minimum and rather invite everybody to come there to see it for themselves.\\nThe issue at hand today is Bosnia, a very serious one, and what should be Canada\\'s role in this bloody civil war. I will preface what I am about to say by mentioning that there are no white knights and no black knights in this situation. Rather there are many gray zones. Atrocities have been committed by all sides. However certainly there has been a preponderance on the side of Serbian aggression.\\nIt is important to note that the people of the former Yugoslavia did in fact live together quite nicely up until the beginning of this century. After World War I and with the collapse of the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires the Serbians, Croats and Muslims were fused together to form what we have come to know as Yugoslavia. There was little rancour beforehand. However ethnic tensions mounted because one group, the Serbians, were given preferential treatment to the expense of the other ethnic groups there. I hope this subject I have just mentioned is not lost on the Her Majesty\\'s Loyal Opposition.\\nThis culminated in World War II as ethnic tensions mounted with the slaughter of over two million Croats and Serbians at each other\\'s hands, a number I might add that far exceeds the number of people who were killed at the hands of the Nazis. This deepened the hatred between the two groups, widened the rift between them, and set the stage for the carnage we see today in all its horror via CNN. As time goes on and the atrocities pile up on both sides, the rift between the peoples widens and the misunderstanding and hatred deepen. That is a profound tragedy.\\nNow that I have presented my preface what will our role be in this conflict? Since there is no peace in existence today, as has been said before, there is no peace to keep in the seething caldron of racial hatred. Is there peace to make? I think so but it will only come through diplomatic channels and not with force. To commit our troops with force today would in my estimation banish them to be just another fourth force in this encounter.\\nAlong this line of questioning are air strikes. Should we or should we not employ them? If we use air strikes the impartiality of the peacekeepers would be forever forsaken. This would set us up for two things. First, it would set us up for full-scale reprisals by all sides that would produce a large loss of life both among the United Nations troops and therefore among our own.\\nIt is interesting to note in these conflicts-and I speak from some personal experience-that one group can go ahead and kill its own people to make it look like another group is doing the killing. It is the easiest way to go against the group that is disliked intensely and against which the other is fighting.\\nSecond, what would happen if we engaged in this conflict-and this is very important to understand-is that it would completely neutralized the humanitarian role the United Nations has engaged in so far. While this role has been imperfect it has indeed saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people from death, rape and torture. Thus I do not think that air strikes are an option.\\nNow we are left with the last option, the humanitarian effort for which we have been given a mandate under the United Nations. At this time I would publicly like to state that it is a role our Canadian men and women have been doing admirably. Often overworked, underarmed and outgunned they have carried out their UN humanitarian role with profound bravery. I would like to extend to them publicly my heartfelt thanks and admiration.\\nShould we engage in this endeavour? If we pull out it can be fairly certain that other member states will pull out too. Therefore no humanitarian aid effort would go through in this conflict whatsoever. It would set the stage for mass genocide. Hundreds of thousands of people would be killed and there would be an escalating conflict.\\nIt is very important to understand that this whole area is a tinderbox. The escalating conflict would involve other countries such as Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Albania, Italy and Germany. I do not think Canadian people would tolerate it.\\nAt this time I would like to hearken back to the holocaust memorials we see every year and our response to them. As we view the horrible footage of Nazi atrocities the world commits naively to say never again. Tragically we may say this and believe it but clearly our heads are stuck in the sand for we have allowed the situation to continue in other countries over the years such as Cambodia, Iraq, Burundi, Sudan and Ethiopia, to name just a few. Bosnia represents an opportunity to say never again and to do something about it.\\nThe soldiers are fighting these dirty little civil wars, but the greatest penalty to pay are the penalties that are paid by the civilians. I can say from personal experience that the penalties are paid by the children, the infirm and the aged. Those are the people who are subjected to the brunt of it.\\nAs a physician and surgeon I worked in Africa and treated people who had suffered under a bloody civil war. I can say I have seen the effects of gunshot wounds, people who were chopped up with machetes, victims of torture and gang rape, children and teenagers with their arms and legs blown off, and the death, social destruction and dislocation that tear apart the very fabric of a country often forever. Once we have seen it we are compelled to do something about it. We cannot turn our backs on it.\\nWhat I have heard is that our soldiers feel the same way. It was perhaps best put most eloquently by a commander of our United Nations forces who said that there was a tremendous feeling of satisfaction when a young man or young woman came home and was able to say: \"I helped keep this peace. I helped save lives. I helped people in distress. I helped people who are much worse off than I am\". It raises the morale of individuals and collectively contributes to the well being of Canadian forces at large.\\nApart from the purely altruistic reasons of continuing these humanitarian efforts there are some very concrete reasons why we should get involved in this venture. By having a leadership role in these multinational peacekeeping efforts, Canada raises its profile, strengthens its positions and gives us leverage across a broad range of diplomatic endeavours.\\nMy philosophy is that we should get involved in these efforts earlier. In that way we can often obviate these situations, not always but sometimes. Bosnia is a case in point. The writing was on the wall in 1987.\\nI would summarize by suggesting the following. First, we should continue to provide humanitarian aid and not pull out of this endeavour. Remember we are there for the innocent civilians and not the combatants. This is another important point to remember. Many of the fighters and their leaders would like us to be out of this conflict so they can continue to increase the pace of the battle, increase the brutality and the killings. If we ask the civilians whether they want us there, they will tell us yes they do because we are often the difference between life and death for them.\\nSecond, do not use air strikes unless we need to protect our own troops.\\nThird, we need to strengthen the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including the freezing of state assets and additional trade restrictions. I would go so far as to say complete isolation of the republic, but I would also engage in trade embargoes and sanctions against any other state that refuses to enter into these peace talks in a legitimate and determined fashion. Bring them to the table.\\nFourth, penalize countries which break the embargo that exists with economic and financial penalties. They are being broken now. I suggest we get on them collectively and do something about it.\\nFifth, continue with diplomatic efforts and let us play diplomatic hardball with these people with the aforementioned sanctions. I would go so far as threatening them with freezing their assets long after this resolution comes about, if they do not come to the table now.\\nSixth, I would demand immediate guarantees for the safe movement of humanitarian aid by UN forces throughout Bosnia.\\nSeventh, create more safe zones where appropriate.\\nEighth, continue with the war crimes tribunal under UN auspices which would hold accountable those individuals responsible for the atrocities that we have seen. I feel that the credibility of international humanitarian law demands a successful conclusion to this endeavour, for if we do not do it the failure of this process will exist. If we do continue, it will act as a deterrent in the future.\\nFinally, I would strongly suggest to the government and in fact plead with it to continue our humanitarian involvement under the UN auspices for the reasons that I have mentioned before. In fact I can probably summarize by saying if you do not do it now, you pay me now or you pay me later. That is what is going to happen.\\nI would like to make a personal plea for two brief things in which I think Canada should take a leadership role. First, Canada should act in a leadership role in banning the manufacture and distribution of anti-personnel devices. These devices from Hades have but one function and that is to maim and not kill civilians. We have seen them used with horrific results in Cambodia and other countries. Even when these conflicts are resolved the country is hamstrung. The people cannot move anywhere. They cannot move any goods and services because of these anti-personnel devices. They are truly horrific.\\nMy second point ties into what I said before. We need to look in the future for potential conflicts. One I would bring to the attention of everyone is the Republic of South Africa. It is a tinder box and going into its elections in April is a very sensitive time. I would suggest that the United Nations consider bringing in an interim observation force to ensure that the elections go ahead in a fair and unbiased fashion. If these elections are perceived as being unfair and rigged, then it could lead to a bloody civil war.\\nI believe my time is up and I thank you for you attention, Mr. Speaker.\\nMr. Speaker, a supplementary for the Minister of Finance.\\nWill he guarantee or at least allay the fears of the Canadian people that he is going to continue the RRSP and that it is not going to be a tax concession to be reduced but rather a personal retirement safety net that is to be encouraged for these people in the future?\\nTopic: Oral Question Period\\nSubtopic: Registered Retirement Savings Plan<s> Represents padding or margin information associated with element.\\nProvides a Padding object with no padding.\\nInitializes a new instance of Padding class using zero values.\\nInitializes a new instance of the System.Windows.Forms.Padding class using the supplied padding size for all edges.\\nInitializes a new instance of the System.Windows.Forms.Padding class using the supplied padding sizes.\\nGets a copy of this object.\\nGets or sets the padding value for all the edges.\\nGets or sets the padding value for the bottom edge.\\nGets the combined padding for the right and left edges.\\nGets or sets the padding value for the left edge.\\nGets or sets the padding value for the right edge.\\nGets or sets the padding value for the top edge.\\nGets the combined padding for the top and bottom edges.\\nall - The number of measure units to be used for padding for all edges.\\nleft - The left padding size.\\nright - The right padding size.\\ntop - The top padding size.\\nbottom - The bottom padding size.<s> Create a Fabulous Home – Senior Style!\\nHere is a checklist for fabulous senior living at home. Today\\'s my 65th birthday and I feel great! I am celebrating not miserating. So, I promise, not to write another depressing article about bolting handrails all over your bathroom.\\nFor me, \"the senior lifestyle\" is now very personal. It\\'s mainly about living comfortably, in whatever style you prefer, and staying healthy while you do it. I built my new house in the context of senior living because I see this as my last home. And now I can use this post to share what I learned. If you are creeping up to senior demographic, or if you just like to plan ahead this may be good information for you. In either case I hope you find it helpful and use it to go about arranging your home in ways that will help you meet those needs.\\nI\\'ve heard that 60 is the new 50 and all that is great. But even though we are healthier and hopefully happier, none of us in this age group, are the same spritely people we were growing up. Still, every one of us is unique and has aged in their own way. I have bad hearing in one ear, lousy vision and I sure don\\'t have much flexibility since my back operation five years ago, but otherwise I feel great! Your issues may vary more or less, but we all have some and we are likely to have more in the future.\\nThe point here is this: For me, living in a hospital-like environment is not going to happen, at least as long as I have a choice. If you are comfortable in your existing home, like me, why not live out your life there safely and peacefully? If that sounds appealing, here is a checklist of things you can do to help make that possible.\\nArrange for a maintenance/repair service team for the home. This is important to keep your home safe and retain its value high. You want to be enjoying your time and not climbing on ladders doing these tasks.\\nID and print a map of all your home\\'s utility shut-off locations: Water, electricity, gas and sewer.\\nArrange for food, shopping and pharmacy delivery. This can be cheaper than going in person.\\nCreate two disaster plans: 1) escape, 2) survival in place. Don\\'t take these lightly. Mother Nature and other problems can and will sneak up on you. Being prepared if something happens will make you feel real good.\\nDeclutter: Start seriously transferring \"stuff\" to others.\\nToilets with senior height seats and \"Washlette\" by Toto-get one here.\\nGet your appliances into new or like-new condition with warranties. You don\\'t want to be worried about these operating as they should.\\nSelf or soft-closing hardware keeps the doors and drawers closed and out of the way. They are quiet also which is nice.\\nYou will always need some small of storage space. Make it easily accessible on the ground floor somewhere. Not in an attic or basement.<s> A note by Mary Baker Eddy in her copy of the Christian Science Hymnal, c. 1898. B00142.\\nCourtesy of The Mary Baker Eddy.

One Label is the title, and the other is your ChooseBoxLabel. You can easily adjust the background color of the ChooseBoxLabel, by using a custom class with a kv rule to create a colored Rectangle for the background. The title Label is more difficult, since the developer of Popup didn\\'t any way to access that title background color. \\nHere is an example of some things you can do:\\nfrom kivy.app import App\\nfrom kivy.clock import Clock\\nfrom kivy.lang import Builder\\nfrom kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout\\nfrom kivy.uix.popup import Popup\\nfrom kivy.uix.label import Label\\n\\nclass MyBoxLayout(BoxLayout):\\n    pass\\n\\nBuilder.load_string(\\'\\'\\'\\n<Label>:  # Note that this affects EVERY Label in the app\\n    canvas.before:\\n        Color:\\n            rgba: 1,0,0,1\\n        Rectangle:\\n            pos: self.pos\\n            size: self.size\\n<MyBoxLayout>:\\n    canvas.before:\\n        Color:\\n            rgba: 0,0,1,1\\n        Rectangle:\\n            pos: self.pos\\n            size: self.size\\n\\'\\'\\')\\n\\nclass BoxL(BoxLayout):\\n    def chooseFile(self):\\n        self.chosePop = Popup()\\n        self.chosePop.title = \\'My Popup\\'\\n        choseBox = MyBoxLayout()\\n        choseBoxLabel = Label()\\n        choseBoxLabel.size_hint_y = 0.2\\n        choseBoxLabel.text = \\'Any Text\\'\\n        choseBox.add_widget(choseBoxLabel)\\n        self.chosePop.content = choseBox\\n        self.chosePop.size_hint = (.5, .5)\\n        self.chosePop.open()\\n\\nclass GUI(App):\\n    def build(self):\\n        self.title = \\'MyApp\\'\\n        Clock.schedule_once(self.do_popup, 3)\\n        return BoxL()\\n\\n    def do_popup(self, dt):\\n        self.root.chooseFile()\\n\\nif __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n    GUI().run()\\n\\nIn the above code, the MyBoxLayout custom class provides a blue background which is only visible if the Label in it is not filling the Layout. The Label rule in the kv provides a background color for the title and the chooseBoxLabel, but it will affect every Label in the App.\\n\\nA: Actually, I think this is really simple.

But the verdict of the lengthy legal document is a thin agreement with much still to negotiate in the years ahead.\\nEconomics and GlobalizationUnited KingdomEuropean UnionEurope\\nA billboard advertisement by the government informing businesses trading with the EU to act before the end of the Brexit transition period.\\nYau Ming Low / Shutterstock.com\\nAfter 9 months of hard negotiations, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen reached an agreement in which neither side can claim victory nor cry in defeat. Compromises load this accord. On December 28, the agreement received unanimous approval from all EU governments. Relief that the UK did not leave without a trading agreement is the principal emotion. The details are wrapped in a lengthy legal document that is only now being dissected. The verdict is a thin agreement with much still to negotiate in the years ahead.\\nBased on an initial reading, what is in this agreement? The EU agreed that future EU regulations over labor, environment, social policy and state subsidies cannot constrain a future UK government. British sovereignty abhors future constraints. But should the UK introduce regulations which give advantage to British or foreign companies, the EU shall retaliate with tariffs whose kind and size will be decided by an independent panel. The composition of such a panel will be equally divided between the UK and EU with an independent arbitrator appointed to make the final judgement. The consequence of this independent review is that weeks will elapse between the UK\\'s decision to favor an industry or agricultural product and the arbitrator\\'s judgement. It can be hoped that the prospect of a decision harmful to the favored British sector may be sufficient to deter the grant of a competitive advantage. However, we should expect harsh exchanges as London defends its regulations and Brussels cries \\'unfair advantage.\\'\\nThe Value of Mackerel\\nFisheries was a highly political issue with fishermen on both sides of the North Sea defending their rights of 45 years to fish in extensive UK waters. A transition period will last for 5.5 years - a compromise between the 15 years initially sought by the EU and the 3 years offered by London. Only at the end of this period will talks begin on fish allocation. Meantime, EU fishermen will continue to have access to the UK\\'s 200-mile maritime economic zone. The issue of what percentage of the value of the EU fish catch must be transferred to UK fishermen was finalized at 25 percent, far lower than the percentage sought by London. We should foresee an enlarged troupe of inspectors at European ports, pouring over fishermen\\'s catch and weighing up the value of fish that each boat owner must transfer to the UK. Disputes will abound, but haggling over the value of mackerel will be kept separate from disputes over other trade issues. Fish fights must be settled on their own merits.\\nThe European Court of Justice will no longer have a role in the administration of British justice, which shall remain sovereign. However, the determination of how migrants are treated and whether they can be returned to one of the 27 EU nations will remain an issue for European justice. France has firmly rejected acceptance of migrants dumped there by the British.\\nBritish students will no longer have access to the Erasmus program which supports UK and EU students studying in each other\\'s countries. But separately, Brussels seeks to raise funds to continue this academic exchange program in order to stimulate a younger generation in the value of EU membership. Meantime, London will contribute 1 billion euros to continue UK scientific collaboration in several EU Research and Development programs, including Euratom as well as Galileo and Copernicus, the EU space program.\\nDebate on Covid-19 relief\\nAn issue that will linger into 2021 is the determination of whether Covid-19 relief funds should be treated as state aid or not. Brussels had wanted to excluded the release of its 750 billion euro ($858 billion) Covid relief fund from any regulations on state aid. The UK is not eligible for this relief and refused to accept that EU countries could count the monies as non-state aid, while any aid that London distributes would be counted as state aid. Clearly, this is an issue for further discussion in 2021 as the 27 plus the UK struggle to envigorate their respective national economies.\\nThe EU had wished for a statement on defense and foreign policy, but that was a leap too far. It will have to wait for a future time when the current trade agreement has been tested and a degree of trust between the officials in both London and Brussels has been restored. The Prime Minister portrayed the negotiations as a victory. The EU Commissioner talked of a just and fair agreement that avoided a hard Brexit. Both sides gained enough to leave town for Christmas, but neither can claim unbound victory.\\nDiana Villiers Negroponte\\nPublic Policy Fellow;\\nProfessional Lecturer, The George Washington University, Elliott School\\nUkraine Quarterly Digest: October–December 2020\\nBy Andrian Prokip on January 7, 2021\\nEU should not rush investment deal with China\\nGlobal Fellow Michelle Egan on Brexit Deal\\nBy Michelle Egan on December 28, 2020\\nBolsonaro & Biden: What\\'s Next for Brazil-U.S. Relations?\\nPopulists in the Kitchen: A Conversation with Andrés Velasco\\nInfographic | Platinum Opportunity: Digitalization of SMEs in Mexico\\nBy Diego Marroquín Bitar on December 17, 2020\\nBolivia\\'s Lithium Future: A Second Chance?\\nWilson Center\\'s Global Europe Program experts comment on the possibility of a \"No Deal\" Brexit.\\nBy Daniel S.

The osteoarthritis patient needs a little to \"to get going\". If the joint has warmed up, the symptoms improve.\\nOf the Stress pain: The joint can sometimes be stressed quite well for a while. After a certain time, however, they worsen the symptoms again. Sometimes the joint feels warm and swells. The symptoms worsen during the day. Rest relieves the symptoms.\\nFurther Characteristics of osteoarthritis are:\\nSwelling of the joint\\nOverheating of the joint\\nSense of stiffness of the joint\\nRestriction of movement of the joint\\nChange in shape of the joint\\nThe leading symptom of arthrosis are the joint pain. They are divided into a so-called Early Triassic and a Late Triassic. The early Triassic occurs primarily in the case of milder osteoarthritis and consists of initial pain, which occurs mainly in the morning after getting up (as the first movement pain), pain from fatigue (after long and monotonous movements) and exercise pain, which mainly occurs during strong stressful movements. The pain has the character of a radiating pain. It can happen that the pain is projected in a completely different place, far away from the area of \\u200b\\u200borigin (e.g. Knee pain at a Hip osteoarthritis).\\nThe Symptoms of the Late Triassic appear mostly in advanced osteoarthritis. They consist of one Persistent painthat occurs independently of movement, one Night pain, which occurs mainly when resting and Pain in the Muscles. The restriction of movement is characteristic of the Late Triassic, which is noticeable in the fact that familiar movements can no longer be performed and blockages in the joint occur. In some cases there is a sensitivity to the weather (patients feel particularly great pain in certain weather conditions). Sometimes so-called crepitations also occur, i.e. bone rubbing. In advanced cases, there are symptoms of thickening of the joints, joint deformities, instability of the joints, Misalignments of the joints and Atrophies of Muscles (sunken muscle bellies). In severe courses, muscle contractures occur, in which the muscles are tight and cramped (cramps).\\nIn the so-called activated arthrosis the joint and the surrounding area are overheated. The joint is also tender. In some cases, a joint effusion forms with swelling. This swelling could be seen on ultrasound.\\nLearn more about the Diagnosis of osteoarthritis\\nAppointment with ?\\nI would be happy to advise you!\\nMy name is dr. Nicolas Gumpert.

Later, lying on the affected shoulder becomes very painful, with certain movements it comes to Pain symptoms and to one Loss of strength in the shoulder. It comes to one limited mobility In everyday life, be it when carrying or lifting, washing your hair or doing sports, many activities are tortured by pain.\\nOften a Crackling or crunching felt in the shoulder when the arm is stretched forward or raised above the head. In addition to the Shoulder pain are common in osteoarthritis Restrictions on rotational movements and lateral spreading observed. The shoulder joint can also be swollen from osteoarthritis. However, the joint is surrounded by strong muscles, which is why it is often difficult to determine the swelling with certainty.\\nIn the further course of the disease it can general movement restrictions come. Often with shoulder osteoarthritis adjacent joints affected, for example in Shoulder joint (Connection between the outer end of the Collarbone and the top of the Scapula). In the advanced stages of osteoarthritis there can be one pain-related relieving posture of the shoulder joint and consequently to a significant functional restriction.\\nSymptoms of knee osteoarthritis\\nThe typical symptom of a Osteoarthritis of the knee (Gonarthrosis) are pain in the knee when climbing stairs such as when walking on unpaved roads. These symptoms are not very specific and are often not recognized as symptoms of osteoarthritis. Usually the knee pain is very strong at the beginning of a movement (so-called Starting pain), then slowly subside and reappear with prolonged exposure (so-called Exercise pain). Become common Pain behind the kneecap complained after sitting for a long time.\\nBesides, it can too grinding or cracking rubbing noises come with knee movements. Those affected also report one increased sensitivity across from damp and cold weather. The knee joint can too swollen, overheated, red and deformed be. The severe pain and swelling often lead to the relief of the knee joint, which becomes measurable after a short time Muscle decline and one Restriction of mobility can lead. This affects the stability of the knee and increases the pain, making the situation worse Vicious circle.\\nThe further the knee osteoarthritis has progressed, the more frequent the pain, which can then also occur at rest or at night. In addition, the mobility of the knee continues to decrease; in rare cases the knee becomes stiff due to osteoarthritis.\\nLearn more about this: Knee osteoarthritis\\nSymptoms of hip osteoarthritis\\nThe Hip arthrosis (Coxarthrosis) often starts very harmless with slight pain at the beginning of a movement, especially after long periods of sitting or in the morning after getting up. The pain subsides after a few steps, but occurs more and more frequently. Movements like that Bending over and descending stairs, but also Turning movements (e.g. when getting out of the car) or that Spread and pull your legs towards you are becoming increasingly difficult.\\nin the advanced stage hip osteoarthritis causes pain even at rest and at night on. Those affected often complain about one Groin pain, which radiates over the thigh to the knee joint on the same side. Often it comes to one after long walks slight buckling of the hip on the affected side or those affected begin to limp. Arthrosis also restricts mobility in the hip joint. The thigh can no longer be bent or stretched without problems, the leg can only be spread apart with pain and rotational movements are hardly or not at all possible. Certain movements can no longer be performed because that Joint blocked.\\nDepending on the extent of the signs of wear, you can also Rubbing noises when walking be heard, the affected person feels that the joint no longer runs \"smoothly\". Symptoms accompanying hip joint arthrosis are common Back pain on the lumbar spine. By relieving posture or incorrect loading due to hip pain, above all that Sacrum-iliac joint and the knee joint affected. Hip joint arthrosis typically does not result in joint swelling or instability in the hip joint.\\nLearn more about the Symptoms of hip osteoarthritis\\nSymptoms of thumb osteoarthritis\\nOf the Joint wear on the thumb saddle joint is also known as Rhizarthrosis called and occurs very often at the same time on both sides on. The first symptoms of the disease are often pain when reaching for heavy objects such as a water bottle. The feeling of a Stiffness of the fingers especially In the morning and Problems with closing fists will be described. At times it can become a so-called activated osteoarthritis come, the thumb joint swells, is reddened and overheated. The thumb saddle joint is the most flexible joint of the thumb and involved in all movement patterns, therefore in most cases there is severe pain.\\nAlso fall Turning movements like turning a key in the lock harder and the Hand strength and sensitivity decrease. Fine motor movements such as unscrewing a screw cap from a beverage bottle are more difficult and require several attempts. The thumb saddle joint can become unstable. In the further course there is one Ossification of the joint capsuleresulting in a deformity (Subluxation) of the thumb in the saddle joint. These changes are visible to the outside, but the mobility of the thumb is usually not restricted. In addition, bone growth processes (formation of osteophytes) become palpable over time.\\nSymptoms of finger osteoarthritis\\nThe characteristic degenerative changes in the joints in osteoarthritis can basically affect every joint in the body.\\nOften, however, the typical osteoarthritis complaints of the fingers or finger joints occur. The vast majority of those affected are middle-aged women.\\nA distinction is made between arthrosis on the end joints of the fingers (so-called Heberden\\'s arthrosis) and those on the middle joints of the fingers (so-called Bouchard\\'s arthrosis).\\nIn general, typical nodules and bulges can be felt relatively early in both forms of arthritis.\\nThe course of osteoarthritis of the finger joints can be very different.\\nOn the one hand, there are patients who have almost no pain or restricted mobility to complain about. On the other hand, however, there are those affected who suffer from severe pain and who may develop misalignments of the fingers and the associated functional disorders in the course of the disease. The first symptoms of the onset of osteoarthritis of the finger joints can be pain that occurs when grasping objects, especially heavy objects. In addition, swelling of the joints can occur.\\nIn the end joints of the fingers (Heberden\\'s arthrosis), a so-called flexion contracture usually occurs over time, which can also be thickened by the bony attachments on the joint. The fingertips are then bent forward and can no longer be fully extended. In addition, this form of osteoarthritis often causes blister-like swellings that are filled with a gelatinous liquid. These are known as mucoid cysts and are easy to empty. Heberden\\'s arthrosis is the most common form of arthritis in the hand.\\nIn the middle joints of the fingers (Bouchard arthrosis), this disease usually manifests itself on several fingers at the same time. Here, too, there is thickening of the joints, which is caused by bone extensions.\\nFinger osteoarthritis\\nBouchard osteoarthritis\\nSymptoms of hand osteoarthritis\\nThe Osteoarthritis in the wrist is a sign of that Wear on this joint. It is about a relatively rare disease and can do both one-sided as well as both sides occur.\\nOften this occurs as a long-term consequence of a malposition that has healed Forearm fractures (mostly distal radius fracture) or Carpal fractures (especially of the scaphoid bone) in appearance. But with some carpal diseases or other inflammatory processes, osteoarthritis symptoms can also occur on the wrist. The most common is that Radiocarpal joint affected, i.e. the joint where the radius (spoke) articulates with the carpal bones.\\nStand primarily Pain and Restrictions on movement in the foreground, as the pain is mostly in Combination with movement occur. Later this pain can also be present at rest and the entire wrist can be deformed.\\nAdditionally can Bone attachments to be felt. Also noticeable is the severe swelling of the back of the hand.\\nIn some cases are Joint inflammation to observe, which are relapsing. In the acute episode it comes to Swelling, redness, pain and Overheating of the joint.\\nPlease also read: Osteoarthritis attack\\nIn some patients the pain is also depending on the weather. Wetness and cold tend to have a negative effect on the symptoms, dry heat, on the other hand, alleviates this.\\nIn the final stages of this disease, however, there are usually very great restrictions on movement and in the worst case it can lead to loss of function of the wrist. Therefore, early and stage-appropriate therapy is essential to maintain the quality of life of those affected.\\nLearn more about the Wrist osteoarthritis\\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis of the foot\\nThe Osteoarthritis of the joints on the foot most often concerns this upper ankle, the joint of the big toe or the Tarsal joints. Arthrosis of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe is also referred to as a so-called Hallux rigidus.\\nThe symptoms are usually felt in the immediate vicinity of the affected joint and are initially expressed in the form of pain.\\nIn the early stages of this disease, the pain usually only occurs in phases and in particular after heavy exercise, such as after long running or jumping movements. After a certain Rest The symptoms usually improve again until they are completely free of symptoms.\\nIn addition to the pain that those affected usually call Tenderness is specified, a Swelling of the affected joint occur.\\nIn a later stage of the disease, the symptoms can persist, i.e. either not at all or not completely. This can limit the function of the affected joint and thus also the mobility of the entire foot. It is also possible that the pain turns out to be so-called Starting pain expresses. This occurs after a long period of rest and then improves with movement.\\nIf the articular cartilage is broken down further in the course of osteoarthritis, the pain also occurs at rest, which is why those affected often tend to relieve themselves, which can be associated with incorrect strain. This in turn can lead to further remodeling / regression of the foot or the surrounding muscles in the further course, which ultimately leads to a Worsening of the functionality of the lower extremity can end.

Something is afoot.\\nToday started out innocently enough--a small carpool hiccup, but nothing unmanageable. I coached my sister who was coming to watch the boys for the morning through the nuances of the kindergarten pick up and headed into the office ready to check things off my list like a woman on a mission. Yeah, that lasted for all of 30 minutes.\\nA quick call from my slightly panicked sister informed me that Preston had hit his head on the sofa table while chasing her dog around the house. Oh the perils of bring your pet to babysit day!\\n\"I don\\'t think it hurt his eye.\"\\n\"It better not be his eye.\"\\n\"So glad I wore my white pants today--perfect for consoling bloodied boys.\"\\nAnd with that the mad hatter\\'s party of a day began.\\nFortunately, the pediatrician\\'s office does do stitches. I say fortunately because, if you remember, they do not do concussions. They don\\'t even look at concussions. Not even if you\\'re standing right in front of them with a puking child you suspect has a concussion. Good for me I\\'m over that little incident (can\\'t you tell I\\'m so over it?) because now I needed them to do stitches. I mean I really needed them to do stitches. I selfishly could not think of something I rather do less than spend the entire day in the ER at Primary Children\\'s again (because that\\'s who does concussions).\\nI did think it odd when I called to give the pediatrician\\'s office a heads up that we were coming in they asked if I thought I could hold Preston down by myself. \"Me hold down a writhing four year old you are trying to sew up,\" I wondered out loud. \"I\\'m not sure. I\\'ve never tried,\" I answered. Her answer? \"Okay, we can just grab some of the medical assistants if we need to, go ahead and come on in.\" Really?\\nMaybe it\\'s just the PR side of me, but who are these people? Isn\\'t possessing some fraction of a calming bedside manner a prerequisite to entering the medical field? If not, it should be because at that point all I could think was that I had a choice to make--Preston was going to be scarred either physically if I chose not take him in, or emotionally if I did. It was a gamble and I do not enjoy gambling.\\nFortunately, calm and rationality took over when a new doc we had not seen in the office before introduced himself to us as our caregiver of the day.\\nHe said: \"Hi, I\\'m Kevin.\"\\nI thought: \"I\\'m sure you mean Doctor Kevin, right? Who goes to all that school and doesn\\'t demand a proper title at least 50 times a day?\"\\nBut I said: \"Great. Can you help my little man?\"\\nA few punny doctor to four year old jokes later, a promise from me of some new Star Wars Legos for bravery, and some serious human glue and Presto and I were both relieved the ordeal was over without any further scars, seen or unseen.\\nOne child mended. One child properly carpooled. One work day shot to--well, just shot. Now it was time to ready the newest for his first physical therapy appointment.\\nYes, according to some well qualified professionals it seems McKay is lagging a bit behind his peer group these days when it comes to moving his mass in age appropriate ways. Me? I\\'ve been skeptical. I think he\\'s just smelling the roses, and half expected the PT to agree with me and wonder what the heck she was doing in our living room with such a strong kiddo. Wrong.\\nHis initial evaluation has resulted in a recommendation for twice weekly appointments with physical and occupational therapists for the next six to 12 months. Hmmm. I wondered what we were going to do with our abundant free time...so glad that problem is solved. Whatever. We always find time to squeeze everything in, right? Here\\'s to enjoying some private coaching that will put Mr. Mac ahead of the pack and ready for his next round of downtime without missing a beat.\\nThe grand finale? The day ended with Matt passing out from a blood draw at his yearly physical and him coming home eerily drained of any sort of energy and color. He spent the rest of the night sipping OJ, drifting in and out of sleep, worrying me that he had driven home in this state. Let\\'s hope the results of the blood test are far less dramatic than the actual blood draw. For the love!\\nI\\'m sure tomorrow morning will bring improved circumstances to our little abode. I\\'m having the windows cleaned, however, and whenever you pay good money for crystal clear views it\\'s a sure bet it\\'s going to rain. No matter. After today, I say bring it on. For now I\\'m glad momma said there would be days like this; not weeks, months, or years. Days I can take. And tomorrow is a new one. Hallelujah.\\nAround the world and back again. Okay it was only Boston. But it was the first time I\\'ve been away from McKay for more than a few hours. Because I somehow landed the most amazing part-time gig a baby momma could hope for, part of my duties include traveling four or five times a year to interview clients and attend conferences. There has been, however, quite a dry spell for independent globetrotting since Mac burst on the scene. But life has found a steady pace and things are good for now, so Matt and I agreed I\\'d better get while the gettin\\'s good so I can keep said fab job.\\nIn addition to meeting with seriously impressive clients, one of the perks of my time away from home is usually a dark, quiet hotel room with fluffy pillows and a wake up call with a time that although usually early, is determined entirely by me. So are you waiting to hear how I slept, slept, slept my night away, woke rested and ready for the next nine months of restlessness? So am I.\\nJust like the crazy mommy I\\'ve been trained to be, I woke every three hours and worried about how the boys were doing at home. I pumped my way out of lactation misery and then laid in bed mad that I was not sleeping. I know. I\\'m insane.\\nThe next day brought adventures navigating Boston which over the last decade put their interstate under ground so as not to mess with the aesthetic of the city. It\\'s a great idea, but not so great for Debbie Directions who sternly told me from the confines of the GPS system she runs that I must turn LEFT now. LEFT now. Re-calculating route. My dearest Debbie, there is no longer a LEFT turn there. There is a wall. In any event, we found our way to the client and had a great day meeting with the big wigs and touring their ice cream factory. Yes. There were samples. Peanut-butter-smothered-in-their-own-hot-fudge samples. Did I not say I have the best job EVER?\\nBack again to the hotel where a dream of mine for a while now met reality when I saw heart baby Luna\\'s mom waiting for me in the lobby. We\\'ve been fast friends separated by far too many miles as we journey through our kid\\'s heart adventures. It was amazing to look her in the eyes and share stories and worries and plans. Yes, many, many wonderful plans. Stay tuned.\\nThen it was home again, home again lickety split to find a nine-month old on the verge of a good cold and ear infections. A couple of quick trips to the pediatrician, pharmacy and home again and we are still trying to return to normal. I was reminded how great our slightly-less-than-optimal is at lunch with a couple of dear friends on Friday. These ladies both have babies who have finished their battles, but left their mommas trying to find their lives again in all that\\'s still here. They are truly glorious and special people. Ear infections? Sniffles? No complaints from me.\\nSo it\\'s Memorial weekend. It\\'s stormy. I\\'m home with a not-so-cheerful McKay and the boys are in \"Vanilla\" (as Preston says with such delight because it shares its name with his favorite ice cream) or Manila as the rest of the world knows it, enjoying a muddy Flaming Gorge with their grandparents, aunt, uncle and daddy. And a Sunday morning at home with no one tell on me means I\\'ve had three cookies and one poached egg for breakfast. Carb. Protein. Sounds complete to me.\\nIt\\'s a quiet house with just one baby. I think I\\'ll follow the advice that is so incessantly offered to first-time mothers but becomes increasingly comical with each subsequent birth--\"Just sleep when the baby sleeps.\" After all, it is nap time. xoxo.\\nWhew. Has it been a week? Really? This week has been a bit like driving my car somewhere only to realize I\\'m not really sure how I arrived safely. Truly our lethal weapon of a life has been in the fast lane on cruise control while we\\'re somewhere in the back enjoying the ride. Oh well. The wind feels good in our hair these days and we\\'re together.\\nSo I guess I should begin this week by saying there is absolutely no way I went an entire week without keeping up this crazy journal of a blog. Not me! The shame.\\nI also did not leave a lovey voicemail of gratitude for my hubby on a particularly cheerful Wednesday afternoon thanking him for our life only to find out later that he deleted it without even listening! I did not in the never-to-be-listened-to message praise him for the fact that his hard work allows me to lay barefoot in the sunshine in our beautiful backyard with three loves of my life and teach them how to enjoy a spring day. I did not gush about how everything we do is better when he\\'s there. No, I did not marry a man that would delete a message like that only to say, \"When I heard it was you and we had talked already, I deleted it. Why?\" Ahem.\\nOh well, maybe if I really do not complain about sucking dirt for 7.1 miles while I try to find my stride and my breath I will win my old backside back from the universe! In all seriousness I\\'m not sure what happened to my body with baby number three, but nothing seems to be in the right place anymore. Of course, I would not question if this is part of what it means to be thirty something and would not secretly wonder if I should make a pact with the devil (or a good trainer) to fix it, replace it, or rearrange it. No, not me!\\nI also did not give birth to the most adorable kids ever. EVER. And I would most definitely not ask you to look at far too many pictures of them (again). (These are also not from McKay\\'s 6 month, Ty\\'s 6-year, and Preston\\'s 4-year old photo shoot done three, yes three, months ago. I would definitely not be that late in getting them ready to share!) Nope! Not me.\\nLate? Not me. I am a terribly punctual person. I\\'m always, always, always on time (it\\'s hard to even type that with a straight face!). One, two, three kids? No problem. Bring it on. No matter the challenge, I am NEVER late. Not me!\\nThat\\'s why I was not amused to learn that when I made a huge extra effort to make sure the boys would be at their baseball games on time Saturday and was not feeling quite smug with myself and the genius of my plan which involved two cars and a staggered exit from the house, to then receive a phone call from Matt which did not let me know that although they were early, I had NOT sent the correct child. What? Apparently is not good enough just to get a child there--it needs to be the one whose team is playing at the time. My bad. The entire incident made me so not scared out of my mind wondering how I will actually manage three little schedules in the years to come and two boys at two different schools next year. The teachers just need at least one warm body there, right? Late? Wrong kid? Not me!\\nNot Me! Monday is the brainchild of a fellow heart momma. You can head over to her blog if you\\'d like to read what she and everyone else have also not been doing this week.\\nor face fear on a regular basis.\\ntoo quick to use the word \"impossible,\"\\nor too hesitant to say, \"yes, you can.\"\\nThe truth? Mother\\'s Day is a lot of work. Good, fun work, but work. Brunches. Dinners. Gifts. But it is all so very worth it. It is what I consider to be the first of the glorious summer holidays; the sort you celebrate outdoors where people you love tend to linger a little longer, laugh a little louder, share a bit more. It was a good day.\\nSo here\\'s my Yea! for all the moms in my life--biological and not. Yea! for all the moms that care for, teach, and otherwise \"village\" my little ones. And a big Yea! for being a mom--it-is-a-deep -down, earn-it-everyday, paid-in-moments privilege of which I think I have only begun to learn.\\nHave you noticed a change in pace lately? In your life? In the world? Over the last few months I\\'ve felt a quickening; as if this small, hurdling piece of rock we\\'re all living on has begun to spin just a bit faster.\\nEverywhere I turn it seems so many I know are facing the impossible. Young mothers (and by young I mean my age of course) hearing the word cancer from a doctor; couples longing for just one (or just one more) child; sick, sick babies; physically, spiritually, and emotionally broken hearts; working mothers who wish they didn\\'t have to; jobless fathers who wish they could lose the \"less\". It seems everyone is fighting a battle.\\nI find myself asking where has all this trial and challenge been until now? Is it really possible that in my former happy-go-lucky life I failed to understand the depth of others\\' struggles? Is it really possible that I assumed we were all living different versions of my intensely blessed existence?\\nI remember apologizing to some close friends following McKay\\'s birth. It was two days before Thanksgiving and we were in the waiting room receiving hourly updates from the surgical staff about McKay\\'s second heart surgery when a dear friend stopped by to offer support. No basket of goodies, no cards, no pretense. He was just there to sit and be with us.\\nSomething in my heart broke when I saw him as my mind flooded with memories that not so long ago his newborn son spent a good deal of time in the ICU due to some complications with his lungs following birth. Of course, I made the standard visit to adore the precious babe and applaud his brave mother, but never called again. Honestly, I didn\\'t even know how long his son was made to stay until I spoke to them over a month later. Even then, I did not feel the weight of my neglect.\\nIn that moment, in that simple and Christ-like visit from a friend, my eyes were opened to the opportunity I missed. They too had come home with empty arms. They too wondered if the night nurse would know exactly how to comfort their son. They too were torn between nurturing children at home and being beside one in the hospital. I cried. I asked his forgiveness. All I could offer by way of explanation for my inaction was that up until McKay, I didn\\'t understand. I\\'m so sorry, I truly did not know.\\nNow I know more. I feel like someone has turned on radar in my soul that was previously unused. I sense more heartache. I understand pain. I relate to helplessness. But at the same time I also know vastly more about joy. I have an intimate relationship with trust. Now, more than ever, I am reaching beyond faith and feel as if I\\'m getting to know my Savior as a friend. I no longer bargain with him or leave my verbal dribble of an offering at His door and run. We are in constant conversation and my life is different because of it. I want to be better. Do better. And, surprisingly, that doesn\\'t always mean more plates of cookies, more gifts. The more I look back on what I needed and the needs I now see in others it is just giving that person time and opportunity to talk, to debrief, to process. Less about me--what I\\'m giving, doing, being-- and more about them.\\nI am not entirely thrilled about leaving my blissful ignorance, but I am amazed at the others I am finally being made to see. Sometimes the lessons others are made to endure are heavy and hard to watch. However, I am always left with the reassuring feeling that none of it is random. There is an order to things. Even when they are hard things—there is order. Yes, my world is spinning a little faster these days, but certainly not out of control. My experiences have given me new eyes, an increased awareness, and I am learning how to use it.\\nWhat have I not been doing this week you ask? Well as a tenured mother of three small boys I would definitely not give my 8 month old a dangerous toy. I would have sorted those all out of our stash at this point, right? I would not foolishly assume that because he has not yet sprouted any pearly whites that he is incapable of biting off part of the toy and nearly choking on it. I would not, of course, let this all happen as I was driving, panic when I heard him choking, swerve dangerously off the side of the road at rush hour, turn on my flashers and began frantically sweeping his mouth for the missing horn of the appropriately styled \"monster\" with which he was entertaining himself. No, I would definitely not do that.\\nAnd to top it all off, I would most definitely not let this all happen when my mother-in-law was in the car. Because if she were in the car to see me panic, swerve, and then say in a determined voice to my darling babe, \"You have pulled through two open heart surgeries, you will NOT choke to death dammit.\" Because at that point she might not ever ride with me or leave me alone with my little Mac again. No I would never let that happen, not me!<s> On January 26, 2015, The Furthering Asbestos Transparency (FACT) Act was introduced into the 114th session of the House of Representatives as H.R. 526. This legislation would hurt asbestos victims and their families by requiring public disclosure of all kinds of personal, private information. We must make our voices heard. Contact your Representative and ask him or her to vote against The FACT Act. Here\\'s the House\\'s tool for finding your Congressional Representative. Tell them to do the right thing and reject this unjust bill.\\nAsbestos corporations are once again trying to make it harder and more dangerous for asbestos victims to get the compensation they deserve from asbestos trusts and the court system. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which, despite the name, is not a government agency) and the corporate-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), have proposed legislation that would require private confidential information about asbestos victims be made public. The real reason for doing this is to make asbestos victims and their loved ones afraid and fearful of exercising their constitutional rights.\\nThe so-called FACT Act (Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act) would require bankruptcy trusts to publish quarterly reports including detailed personally identifiable information about victims and their families. Private information would be published on the internet for all to see: the last 4 digits of Social Security numbers, information about personal finances, information about minor children who were exposed at an early age, and private information about work history. This type of information would make asbestos victims vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, scams, and other predators. Further, publishing this private data could result in the denial of credit, employment, housing, and life, disability, and health insurance.\\nNo private information about asbestos defendants would be made public by this supposed \"transparency\" act. Only victims of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases would lose their rights to privacy in settlement negotiations. It is completely one-sided and unfair. No other kind of litigation requires these barbaric steps and no other kind of plaintiff is subjected to this treatment.\\nThe FACT Act would also increase the costs to asbestos bankruptcy trusts, which would have to pay to compile the information and create public websites to display it. These costs serve only to take money away from the limited amount of money available to victims. Asbestos victims are never made whole after an asbestos company has declared bankruptcy, as the amount of money is always limited. This bill would serve to further reduce payments to mesothelioma and other asbestos victims. It would not apply to any other type of trust created by the bankruptcy courts.\\nVeterans will be harmed by this bill. Many veterans were exposed to asbestos while serving their country aboard ships. Trucks, tanks and airplanes were also insulated with deadly asbestos. Veterans often went on to take civilian jobs similar to the jobs they performed in the military, and were exposed to asbestos in those positions. It is estimated that almost one-third of persons diagnosed with mesothelioma are veterans of the U.S. military. The FACT Act would hurt the very people who were there for our country when we needed them most.\\nThis bill is not about transparency. It is about delaying and denying payments to the very people whose lives and health were destroyed by the asbestos companies. It is a cruel irony that companies whose failure to transparently reveal the truth of what they knew about the hazards of asbestos exposure now seek to destroy the very privacy of their victims, and reduce their compensation even further. It is a shameless attempt to revictimize those who have already suffered so very much.\\nAgain, asbestos victims and their families must make their voices heard. Contact your Representative and ask him or her to vote against The FACT Act, House Resolution 526. Here\\'s the House\\'s tool for finding your Congressional Representative. Tell them to do the right thing and reject this cruel bill.<s> Mercury inhibits methylation, which is the biochemical process that affects the production of many hormones and neurotransmitters. It also causes a selective loss of Purkinje neurons in the brain which produce GABA.\\nMercury is known to concentrate in glands, including the thyroid and blocks the enzyme that converts T4 to T3. Also, your mercury burden is a chronic stressor that seems to provoke symptoms of adrenal fatigue.\\nErethism: It\\'s the mercury personality, and that involves excessive timidity, diffidence, shyness, conflict avoidance, loss of self-confidence, anxiety, a desire to remain unobserved and unobtrusive, a pathological fear of ridicule and explosive loss of temper when criticized.

After enjoying a nice cup of herbal tea with her, she shared a few things about mercury toxicity in her pretty back garden. Here is one of the videos we did – enjoy!\\nHere is a link to part 2 of this discussion- what to do and additional resources.\\nThis was a very informative talk, and I am looking forward to part II. I think I have mercury toxicity from dental amalgams, though all but one have been removed. I have Hashimoto\\'s thyroiditis, celiac disease, fibromyalgia, and 2 copes of MTHFR for methylation defect. I am trying to improve my methylation with supplements and get all these issues under control. I am eager to find a safe way to test and detox for mercury. Because of the MTHFR defect and leaky gut, is there a safe way to get the mercury out and not have it reabsorbed into the brain and elsewhere? Thanks.\\new\\'re pleased you found it informative – Kris is very thorough and detail-oriented! You\\'ll enjoy part 2.\\nOne of the reasons I was initially hesitant to have someone come and talk on mercury is that I don\\'t have an answer on safe ways to remove the mercury so I\\'m afraid there is no easy answer for you on this one. One of the main reasons to talk about this is: creating awareness to prevent it continuing to happen (amalgam use and consumption of fish that are not very low mercury); and to give you some possible clues as to whether this could be one reason why you may may have strange unresolved health issues.\\nI thank Kris for helping me realize it is important that we get this information out. At the same time I\\'m aware it\\'s far from ideal when I don\\'t have a solution for detoxing from the mercury and I\\'m sorry about this.\\nI\\'ll have Kris hop on and add her thoughts too.\\nLinda, I would suggest working with Pam Killeen (pamkilleen.com) on getting out the toxic metals and rebalancing the body.\\nExcellent research, thank you. For some reason, nobody tell about symptoms of mercury toxicity which I had: feeling heated even from walking for a long time, covering myself with comforter and especially when I took bath or shower. I had to take cool shower because my hear would pound at night. The reason- mercury starts to evaporate when it is heated. I have removed mercury and have done detox with challenge but still have palpitation and blood sugar fluctuations. Anxiety is greatly reduced which adrenal support and stress management.\\nThanks for sharing Lisa – I\\'m so pleased to hear your anxiety is greatly reduced. And glad you enjoyed the research.\\nI\\'m going to see if Kris will comment on the heated feeling you mention and if she has heard it could be a symptom related to mercury toxicity.\\nIn the meantime a few things come to mind: heat intolerance is a symptom of low serotonin and we heard how mercury toxicity can affect serotonin production. Also it could be a possible effect on the hormones – we often hear how the thyroid gland can be seen as the furnace and the pituitary gland as the thermostat.\\nExcellent interview and so glad the topic has come up. I am one of those with so many issues, I am overwhelmed and don\\'t know where to turn. I have been on a healing journey for over 15 years and have been told by numerous practitioners that I have a \"cascade of symptoms.\" Even though I have known that mercury is probably a root cause for me, and I have tried to deal with it in different ways, I have not found a practitioner who can address it well. Most do not want to do another provoked test on me because I am extremely sensitive. The last test (2003) before I had my amalgams replaced showed high mercury, lead and cadmium. I was given penicillamine to test then to chelate me, and my candida really flared up. I have also heard that there needs to be a \"balance\" between the candida and the mercury. I think that is when I just gave up on this piece since candida continues to raise its ugly head. \"Balance\" seems impossible.\\nI live about an hour from D.C. and would love to know if anyone can recommend a good practitioner in this field. I have been a patient of NIHA in the past.\\nI would suggest working with Pam Killeen (pamkilleen.com). I don\\'t know whether she can help you long distance, but many holistic practitioners do. Good Luck to you.\\nThe best tests are the hair test (but interpretation is key) and the porphyrins panel (if the sample is handled carefully). These are described in the link, \"Chronic mercury poisoning: A brief summary of the science\" that Trudy provided on this webpage.\\nAssuming you are a poor excretor, then as Trudy notes, there is no great way to remove the mercury. 🙁 Since your exposure has ended, the body can begin to remove it on its own, albeit slowly. Many practitioners have products that may or may not help with this, but it may be a long process, so find a path that you can sustain. You may want to read about the Cutler protocol for low frequent dose oral chelation, which is considered the most rational method, though may be too strong for some.\\nOn the bright side, many people find they feel better once they understand mercury toxicity and learn how to compensate for it via nutrition and other health practices.\\nYour temperature dysregulation could be a symptom of a thyroid problem, which could be due to mercury. I didn\\'t realize that it also could be due to low serotonin as Trudy mentioned.\\nHeart palpitations are common with mercury toxicity, and might be alleviated with magnesium (in an absorbable form) and hawthorn, but Trudy may know more about this that I do.\\nThere is no need to do another test for mercury. Once you test positive, mercury is likely the root cause of whatever symptoms you continue to have.\\nCandida can be very hard to overcome. It took me over two years of a perfect diet plus lots of sauerkraut and probiotics.\\nIt\\'s best to view practitioners as consults rather than authorities; it\\'s best to do your own thinking. (Yes, it\\'s difficult.) I don\\'t know of a practitioner near DC, but you might look for an autism practitioner, since much of autism is mercury toxicity.\\nRegarding re-testing: I hope that all the supplements, natural detox practices, energy work, etc. have reduced the amount of mercury in my body, even though I still have a lot of mercury-toxicity symptoms. I had hoped I could test in a safe way and find out where my levels are. Is that possible and/or important? I did have a Melisa test from King James Medical Lab. in 2004 that showed I have a \"significant allergy\" to inorganic mercury, led and nickel. Do you think that could mean that even the smallest amount will create mercury-related symptoms?\\nThanks so much. I appreciate your journey and your sharing. As you know, this can be \"crazy-making\" to say the least.\\nLynne, there\\'s really no need to test again. Since you already had a mercury test of some kind that was positive, and since you continue have some symptoms that are consistent with mercury, you can continue on your healing journey, keeping in mind that mercury is a likely root cause for you, which means you probably need extra micronutrients and stress reduction. (I\\'m not a treatment expert; it\\'s highly individualized. The Internet support groups can help.) If you don\\'t mind spending money, you could order a hair test to see if your body is processing essential minerals normally, or not. Yes, this is indeed crazy-making!\\nWow-Thank you SO MUCH! I was poisoned by mercury after a trip to the dentist in 1981. My life was turned upside down. Spent years trying to find help. Finally found a Hal Huggins book \"It\\'s All in Your Head\" that confirmed all my symptoms. Had my fillings replaced in 1990 which helped but I\\'m still on my healing journey. I was able to a find a doctor who didn\\'t think I was crazy who said I had Wilsons Syndrome -low body temperature.Not Wilsons(copper)disease)He was able to bring up my temperature 2 degrees and I felt a little better. Listening to you, I could relate to EVERYTHING–and it\\'s so nice to hear the explanation behind it all. In 2010, I found a chiropractor who does Nutritional Response Testing and he was able to diagnose me with high mercury levels through muscle testing and his \"testing kit\" and was able to remove the mercury with Standard Process Supplements Parotid PMG and Cholocol ll.\\nOne pulls the mercury out of the cells and the other helps pass it through the body.It took about 2 months to remove it all.Not sure if it\\'s really all out as I feel better but I still have chronic fatigue, low energy and food sensitivities and spells of zoning out. I\\'m hoping to eventually repair ALL of the damage that was done–don\\'t know if that could ever happen but I can\\'t wait to hear Part 2! THANK YOU!\\nGlad you enjoyed it. You and I are part of the small subset of the population who become very ill from mercury exposure. I suspect that a much larger subset is slightly ill from mercury without realizing it. I too still have symptoms, and I too hope to get better, because the body is designed to heal.\\nTrudy, first I want to commend you on putting on an excellent, and truly helpful, summit. You are helping a lot of people with this info. Hats off to you, and keep up the great work.\\nSecondly, I want to let you know that your talk today with Kris Homme about mercury toxicity (esp. from dental amalgam fillings) being a root cause of many people\\'s anxiety, panic disorder, and/or depression (as well as bipolar depression) is, HANDS DOWN, the best talk of this summit.\\nIt is an EXTREMELY important, and yet still relatively obscure, subject, that needs to get a ton more attention put on it, b/c a countless number of people are suffering tremendously everyday, needlessly, due to a lack of this information.\\nNot only is mercury toxicity (most often from dental amalgam fillings) often the ROOT CAUSE of these anxiety disorders – but it is a very POTENT cause of it of as well – meaning that it can often manifest in people as very SEVERE forms of anxiety (not just relatively \"mild\" cases) – even sometimes totally debilitating.\\nI know this extremely well from personal experience. About two weeks after I had my 8 amalgam fillings removed several years ago, my 20 year chronic/daily state of severe panic disorder, as well as severe bipolar-type depression, was completely and radically CURED.\\n(As a side note – from the many years of research I\\'ve done on this topic (similar to what Kris has been doing), I\\'ve come to discover that there are some different reactions in people to amalgam removal. Not everyone becomes cured of a severe ailment(s) as immediately as I did (but some do). For others, it takes longer – for a significant percentage, amalgam removal alone does not provide as radical an improvement – it also takes a good amount of time doing chelation, to do the job).\\nIt\\'s a bit of a complex subject, as there are many variables, and everyone\\'s bodies and histories are different – but the bottom line is that there are many, many cases of people being either cured, or at least radically improved, after judiciously done chelation therapy (often over the course of at least a couple of years).\\nThe type of chelation that I\\'ve been doing – and of which I\\'ve heard of such \"success stories\" mentioned above – is the low-dose, frequently administered, oral chelation protocol developed by Andrew Hall Cutler, PhD (of which Kris also advocates). (The other methods of chelation out there – such as IV chelation, or the use of \"natural chelators\", such as chlorella – can be potentially harmful, and even dangerous).\\nThe bottom line is that mercury toxicity, esp. from dental amalgam fillings (which is the largest source of mercury for most people), is 1) not a \"conspiracy theory\", and 2) not actually a \"controversial\" subject in the true sense (it\\'s only \"controversial\" b/c the people who consider it controversial still don\\'t know enough facts about it).\\nThe topic of amalgam mercury poisoning in people (causing diseases and disorders) is simple *biological reality*.\\nPerhaps one day – and hopefully one day soon – the \"mainstream public\" will finally catch on to this fact. In the meantime, talks like Kris Homme\\'s today, help deliver such messages to a wider audience. Thank you to you both, Kris and Trudy!\\nThank you for sharing your story and for your very kind words! I agree with you – Kris is really quite the hero and very active in getting this message out there. I am so pleased to have the opportunity to help her do so!\\nKris, I also wanted to say to you – that as a fellow amalgam mercury poisoned person, I really commend you on what you are doing… for giving this excellent talk today on the Anxiety Summit (can\\'t wait for Part 2!! Thank you Trudy, for giving this very important topic two sessions!)… and also, I know about some of the other things you\\'ve done for this cause.\\nI saw a video a while back, of you speaking about this topic in front of a packed room, in front of FDA officials (at an FDA Town Hall meeting type thing). That took a lot of guts. And whenever or wherever you speak, you do so in a very articulate and knowledgeable way. You do us amalgam mercury poisoned people proud!!\\nAlso, I know of the help and input you\\'ve provided people in the past on the Yahoo amalgam mercury poisoning online groups.\\nIn my eyes, you are quite a hero – and I hope your journey to recovery and good health are going well and as quickly as possible!! Thank you again!\\nThis interview really gave me more ideas about missing pieces. I was surprised to hear the limits of metal bloodwork– I ruled out metal tox after everything tested negative. Also found the connective tissue and mitochondrial info revealing. Glad to know more what to look for in the hair analysis as well. And funny to hear some of those erethism\\'s, spacing out, sensory overload, etc. have physiological connections.\\nThank you both for exploring the subject in such a considered and informative way. I had my amalgams removed over 25 yrs ago, with a dental dam (cutting edge at that time– and sadly, that dentist died close to age 50 of unexplained illness). I\\'ve been chronically ill the past 3 years with a list of symptoms that have led to many discoveries, including compound heterozygous MTHFR gene.\\nLast year Cleveland clinic MD asked if I could just narrow my list of symptoms because it was too complex. He rolled his eyes at my supplements. But I\\'m hearing so many people in these summits with similar levels of multi-system complexities. I didn\\'t consider mercury a factor until now.\\nI can\\'t tell you what a gift it is to have seminars like this & the digestive & depression summits, that empower us with ideas, approaches and the knowledge we are NOT MAKING THIS UP.\\nTrudy, your interviews are so clear and focused. You not only highlight the speakers\\' knowledge, your whole manner conveys compassion, balance & generosity of spirit.\\nThank you for such a fascinating talk. So much new information and more to come in part 2!!\\nI am an ex dentist and just finished naturopathy but due to depression/ anxiety and the \\' Mercury\\' personality you talked of, I have not managed to start work yet.\\nI believe Mercury could be the root cause of my illness. Nutrients and herbs help instead of SSRIs but not enough. I have had two hair mineral analyses done that show low essential minerals and low Mercury visible. I have Andy cutlers Hair interpretations test and a good lab here, Interclinical labs have a wealth of practitioner manuals but it\\'s all a steep learning curve.Gene testing also is another huge area. I shall try the Porphyrins test if available here in Australia.\\nHer brainwashed pseudo-science beliefs on \"climate change\" diminish her credibility. She should listen to Chris Monckton and Alex Jones.\\nThanks for your enthusiasm about this topic and for your detailed, insightful comments. I hope Trudy will continue to cover this issue. I know it\\'s difficult and I realize it might not appeal to a wide audience due to lack of awareness about its insidious toxicity.\\nI\\'m glad that your mood disorders were cured by amalgam removal. And I\\'m glad you pointed out that individual recoveries can vary widely.\\nYou mentioned the FDA hearing on amalgam in 2010. I naively thought that after we gave the agency our science-based testimony and our science-based legal arguments, they would restrict amalgam. We learned that the staff had drafted a response but it was blocked by the H&HS Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius — so it must have contained some restrictions that were unpopular with the dental industry. The agency recently agreed to respond to our legal petitions by the end of this year, but it wouldn\\'t surprise me if industry pressure causes them to miss the deadline. However, the science has become irrefutable in recent years, so it\\'s just a matter of time before the FDA must restrict amalgam. And at that point, mainstream medicine may start to acknowledge this devastating illness.\\nI\\'m so glad you find the summit useful. I had hoped to reach people like you, who\\'ve been tested incorrectly for mercury, who\\'ve had to put up with impatient doctors dismissing symptoms and rolling their eyes about supplements. I wrote the journal article (to which Trudy has linked at the top of this blog) to be short and readable, with the intent that patients could give it to any disbelieving doctors (although doctors still don\\'t want to deal with complicated illnesses).\\nI agree that Trudy is terrific. In our pre-interview chats, she really honed in on the details to clarify what is science versus speculation, and I think the result is a talk that is packed with good information.\\nI\\'m glad you enjoyed the talk. Your training in both dentistry and naturopathy is ideal for a number of things, including teaching dentists and other naturopaths about mercury toxicity. Or writing about it if you prefer self-paced work. You might enjoy joining the IAOMT. Incidentally, Andrew Cutler\\'s Amalgam Illness book lists a number of lab anomalies that are associated with mercury — this can give you some insight about whether you have a burden, without spending money on a porphyrins test.\\nI\\'m sorry if you were sidetracked by my discussion of Boyd Haley\\'s advocacy. He is courageous for withstanding the peer pressure that scientists face to avoid advocacy on almost every science issue.\\nComplicated issue. Klinghardt MD has lots of info about this. Mercury testing is iffy. Mercury can hide so testing blood or hair will only give a piece of the picture. Mercury needs to be mobilized then binders are needed for excretion. Alpha lipoic acid and or cilantro mobilize mercury out of the brain where it can hide and chlorella binds it and move it out. Long process. Cutler\\'s protocol is way too complicated and has not been that effective for me. Mercola.com also has some info on this.\\nThank you for your comments. I\\'d like people to know that the hair test is useful not as a direct test for mercury levels but as an indirect test to see whether mercury is altering the processing of ESSENTIAL minerals. You are right that the issue is complicated.\\nWow. First of all I\"m sorry to hear Kris suffers from mercury poisoning. However I am glad she is putting it to such a positive use by educating the rest of us about the dangers. Hope the Summit is going great.\\nIs there no solution to Mercury poisoning?\\nRecovery can be very slow, which is why I think it\\'s crucial that the FDA ban mercury dental amalgam.\\nThis is good information to have. I have avoided flu shots because I read they have high levels of mercury in them. I\\'m afraid to get more in my body than I already have.\\nGreat information. It\\'s amazing how even after all this time there\\'s still not a lot of publicity about how dangerous mercury poisoning is for our health and, now we know, our mental wellbeing.\\nThank you for all you are doing to bring this information to a broader awareness.\\nYour articles always provide excellent and helpful information which is not readily available anywhere else in one place.\\nWhoa information overload! So much good info coming from your summit I think I will have to go back again and again!\\nDo you have a list of common symptoms of mercury poisoning?<s> Отрантские мученики или Антонио Примальдо и сподвижники ()\\xa0— 813 жителей города Отранто, принявших мученическую смерть за отказ принять ислам. Имена мучеников неизвестны, кроме одного пожилого портного Антонио Пеццула, который призвал заключённых не отрекаться от христианской веры. Были причислены к лику блаженных в 1771 году и канонизированы 12 мая 2013 года. Отрантские мученики, монахини Мария Лаура Монтойя-и-Упеги и Мария Гваделупе Гарсия Савала стали первыми святыми, которых канонизировал папа Франциск. Отрантские мученики стали самой большой группой святых когда-либо канонизированных римскими папами. Покровители города Отранто и архиепархии Отранто.\\n\\nИстория \\n\\n28 июля 1480 года оттоманский флот в составе 90 галер, 40 галиотов и других судов (в общей сложности около 150 экипажей численностью около 18 тысяч человек) прибыл из Валлоны (сегодня\\xa0— Влёра, Албания) и предпринял штурм Отранто. Город, который в то время насчитывал около 6 тысяч человек, был не в состоянии долго противостоять нападению. 29 июля город военный гарнизон Отранто и все жители покинули городские оборонительные сооружения и укрылись в городской крепости.\\n\\nГедик Ахмед-паша предложил горожанам сдаться. Когда капитаны военного гарнизона Франческо Цурло и Антонио де Фалькони ответили отказом, символически выбросив ключи города за стены крепости, оттоманская армия возобновила бомбардировку. После 15-дневной осады Гедик Ахмед-паша приказал 11 августа взять крепость штурмом. После того турки разрушили одну из стен и проникли в крепость, началась резня, во время которой мужчины старше 15 лет были убиты, а женщины и дети обращены в рабство. По некоторым данным в Отранто и его окрестностях было убито около 12 тысяч человек и отправлено в рабство около 5 тысяч человек.\\n\\nОставшиеся в живых укрылись в местном соборе вместе со священниками и архиепископом Стефано Пендинелли. Гедик Ахмед-паша предложил укрывшимся принять ислам, но получил категорический отказ, после чего турки ворвались в храм во время совершения литургии и убили всех находившихся в нём. Архиепископ Стефано Пендинелли был изрублен саблями, ему отрубили голову, которую после воткнули на пику и носили по городу. В этот же день были арестованы немногим более 800 мужчин старше 15 лет. За двадцать заключённых была внесена плата в размере трёхсот дукатов за каждого и они были освобождены. Три дня спустя, 14 августа, закованных и раздетых заключённых в количестве 813 человек группами по 50 человек отвели в окрестности населённого пункта Минерва, располагавшегося недалеко от Отранто. Арестованным было предложено для сохранения их жизни отречься от христианства и принять ислам. Пожилой портной Антонио Пеццула призвал заключённых быть верными своей вере, за что был обезглавлен первым. Позднее Антонио Пеццула за свой подвиг получил среди местных жителей прозвище «Примальдо» (Первый). Согласно местному преданию обезглавленное тело Антонио Пеццулы стояло до конца казни и палачи не смогли с ним ничего сделать. Один из турецких палачей по имени Бернабей был так потрясён стойкой верой заключённых, что исповедовал на месте казни веру во Христа, за что сразу же был убит своими товарищами-палачами.\\n\\nПрославление \\nТела убитых были захоронены на месте казни и пролежали здесь до следующего года, когда они были перенесены в 1481 году в собор Отранто. В 1485 году мощи около 250 мучеников были перенесены в Неаполь и помещены в алтарь Пресвятой Девы Марии Розария церкви святой Екатерины Александрийской. В 1888 году архиепископ Отранто и апостольский администратор архиепархии Фоджа-Бовино подарил часть мощей отрантских мучеников санктуарию Пресвятой Девы Марии в Бовино, где они были помещены в алабастровой  урне работы итальянского скульптора Паскуале Гарофало в крипте новой базилики города Бовино.\\n\\nМученическая смерть жителей Отранто вызвала широкий отклик по всей Италии, реакцию Святого Престола и правителей итальянских княжеств. Итальянский драматург Людовико Ариосто написал драму «», посвящённую подвигу Отрантских мучеников.\\n\\nС 1771 года мощи большинства мучеников находятся в семи стеклянных высоких шкафах в соборе Отранто и их можно увидеть. В некоторых шкафах видны нетленные останки тел убитых.\\n\\nБеатификационный процесс начался в 1539 году по инициативе архиепископа Отранто Пьетро Антонио де Капуа и закончился 14 декабря 1771 года, когда папа Климент XIV причислил отрантских мучеников в лику блаженных. 6 июля 2007 года папа Бенедикт XVI издал декрет, в котором признал, что Антонио Примальдо и сподвижники были убиты «из-за ненависти к вере». 20 декабря 2012 года кардинал Анджело Амато обнародовал декрет о чуде исцеления от тяжёлой формы рака у монахини Франчески Левоте, которое совершилось по заступничеству Антонио Примальдо и его сподвижников. 11 февраля 2013 года в Ватикане состоялась консистория, во время которой папа Бенедикт XVI объявил о своём предстоящем отречении и канонизации отрантских мучеников.\\n\\n12 мая 2013 года папа Франциск причислил к лику святых отрантских мучеников. Канонизация мучеников прошла на площади Святого Петра в присутствии президента Колумбии Хуана Мануэлья Сантоса Кальдерона. В церемонии канонизации приняли участие 68 священнослужителей, в том числе 6 кардиналов и 23 епископа.\\n\\nДень памяти в Католической церкви\\xa0— 14 августа.\\n\\nСм. также \\n Список святых, канонизированных папой римским Франциском\\n\\nПримечания\\n\\nЛитература \\n Paolo Ricciardi, Gli Eroi della Patria e i Martiri della Fede: Otranto 1480—1481, Vol. 1, Editrice Salentina, 2009\\n Grazio Gianfreda, I beati 800 martiri di Otranto, Edizioni del Grifo, 2007\\n\\nСсылки \\n\\n Отрантские мученики \\n Причислены к лику святых 800 мучеников Отранто и две монахини.

The biggest addition will be to expand the timeline from John & Liv\\'s marriage in`1910, up to their wedding anniversary in 1969. As many have noted, precise dates of events & family members are not consistent across the whole series & reunion films We may only keep track of what was given to us and make our best guess to connect their story.\\nHere is a detailed Walton family history, written by John Viens in 2008. It spans the arrival of Rome 1789 up to John (son of Zeb) entering adulthood (age ~15yr).\\n*The first Waltons on the mountain were Rome and Rebecca Lee Walton. Rome Walton came and settled what came to be known as Waltons Mountain in 1789. He brought with him, an ax, a mule, a plow and a rifle. He cleared his land for planting in the Spring of 1796 and went all the way to Buckingham County to get a Guernsey cow to put on it. Sometime that Spring he married Rebecca Lee and brought her there to settle on the mountain. They had at least two sons, one being Samuel Walton, the father of Zeb and the other, the father of Zadok Walton. Rome and Rebecca Lee raised their children on Waltons Mountain and the family flourished. The work was hard but the evenings were spent with Rome serenading the family with tunes on his fiddle. His favorite tune was Old Rosin the Beau. He would teach this to his young grandson Zadok, who would inherit not only Rome\\'s love of music, but also his treasured fiddle. Zadok would one day pass this treasure on to his cousin Zeb\\'s grandson Jason Walton, who shared in the Walton musical talent.\\nSamuel Walton grew up and married Zula Tyler. They settled on Waltons Mountain and they had at least six children. First was Henry in 1841, then their came sons, Ben, Charlie, Matt and Zebulon Tyler. They also had a daughter Melissa, that Zeb mentions to Jason in a later episode. The name Tyler is mentioned several times in the series, including the episode The Pony Cart, where Martha Corrine mentions the Tylers. Zeb was the youngest in his family. He was a full twenty years younger than his brother Henry. All the Walton sons grew up and inherited their piece of The Mountain. Not all of them stayed there though.\\nHenry fought for the Army of Virginia in the War between the States. He came home and married Martha Corrine Tyler, a cousin on his mother\\'s side. They settled up on Blue Rock Creek. They had two sons, Boone, born the same year as Henry\\'s baby brother Zeb, 1862 and a baby boy, named Henry who died in infancy. Henry Walton died in 1921 at the age of 81. His widow Martha Corrine and his grown son Boone continued to live on Blue Rock Creek Boone married and had a son. There was a flood and Boone lost his son and daughter in law. They raised their grandson Wade after that. Henry Walton\\'s family was forced to move from Blue Rock Creek in 1934, after the Government confiscated their land for the Blue Ridge Parkway. Martha Corrine Tyler-Walton spent the remainder of her years in Brightwood. Martha Corrine died in 1939 at the age of 91.\\nAs for the other Walton brothers, Ben married and moved to Goochland County and it is said, had a large family. Charlie Walton stayed on the mountain but no real mention is made of him except in the episode The Deed, when Zeb talks about Uncle Charlie meeting up with a bear. Matt Walton married and had a daughter Cora, who grew up and married Hamilton Denbee. They had a son, Job and spent many years in Kansas, moving back to Virginia during the Dust Bowl years. They attempted to settle on Waltons Mountain again but ended up going on to New York and farming the Mohawk Valley after learning that Matt Walton had sold his land to his brother Zeb.\\nZebulon Tyler Walton was the youngest son.\\nHe stayed on Waltons Mountain, married a young girl they called Sissy Morgan. Sissy came from a very proper family with a strict Baptist up bringing, which was quite a contrast to Zeb\\'s footloose and boistrous personality. She would pretend to scold but Sissy or Esther which was her Christian name, loved him for it. Even as a young couple, Esther took to calling Zeb \" The Ol Fool\", which had love in every syllable. Zeb and Esther married in 1883, when Zeb was 21 and Esther 17. Esther had wanted to be a seamstress and open her own dress shop but she gave that up to stay with Zeb on the mountain. Their first home was the log cabin on the mountain where Zeb had been raised. They took care of Zeb\\'s folks in their later years.\\nAt some point, Zeb and Esther built their own home at the foot of the mountain. It was a big white two story house and they built it with their own hands. For several years it didn\\'t seem as Zeb and Esther would be blessed with children even though both had hoped for a large family. But finally, in about 1889, their first son Benjamin was born.\\nThey ware over joyed. About two years later, they had another baby but it died at birth. The third and last child of Zeb and Esther Walton was a son born in 1897. They named him John. John would share his father\\'s love of the land and would spend his life on Waltons Mountain\\nIn their early years together, Zeb and Esther built their home at the foot of Waltons Mountain. They built it big because both truly expected to fill it up with lots of kids and in the meantime, they liked lots of company. Zeb came from a large extended family so they always had company. Zeb\\'s brothers and their families aunts uncles and cousins were always welcome guests, not to mention Zeb\\'s mamma and pappa. Zeb was a man who liked excitement.\\nAlthough he was born on Waltons Mountain and always had a love of his family and the mountain itself, he always dreamed of other places and of adventures. Zeb loved hearing the talk of folks moving west and of great battles in long ago wars and the late war between the states that his own brother Henry had fought in. So, it was little wonder in early 1898, when men were being called to serve with Teddy Roosevelt in what would be called the Spanish American War, that Zeb\\'s heart would be stirred once more.\\nSeveral friends of Zebs were going to Cuba and it was all he could talk about. Finally, even though it was against her better judgement, Esther insisted Zeb join up with the Rough Riders and go fight the war in Cuba. She said later she didn\\'t want Zeb to hate her for holding him back and it was with this thought in mind, that she let Zeb go. So off he went to the war in Cuba and Esther and their two boys stayed home on the mountain to await his return. Esther would say she was proud of Zeb for doing his duty but it was the worst time of her life. She learned early on that life could throw you curves but faith would get you through. So, she spent her days working hard and enjoying her boys waiting for word from her Ol Fool and for the day he would come home.\\nThe day did come when Zeb came home from Cuba. It was the Spring of 99 and home he came to his Sissy, his boys Ben and John and his beloved mountain, never to leave again.\\nLife continued on Waltons Mountain, the seasons came and went and Zeb and Esther taught their boys the value of family, work, the land and God. They had many good neighbors in those years, The Baldwins, The Godseys who owned the local Mercantile, the Roswells, Sneads and Brimleys to name a few. There was a lot of activity at the local Baptist Church which Esther stayed very involved in and always a barn raising or some affair the family would attend. Those were truly good years.\\nIt was also during these years that the two boys were growing up. Ben was the oldest and pretty much looked after his brother John and kept him in line for he was a bit on the wild side from time to time, although serious at the same time. John was never much for school or church going. He preferred to working out doors with his pa, going fishing or just taking long hikes up Walton\\'s Mountain. Ben was the more serious student and a very hard worker. He had his mother\\'s sense of work and duty. Although John also had that Walton Work ethic and you could always trust both boys to see a job through to it\\'s end, you could tell Ben was the business man to be, while John was to be a man of the land who liked to have a real good time.\\n*fixed typographical errors & some misspellings.\\n* formerly Zadok, who needed to go tend some apple trees over in Big Spruce\\nLast Edit: Jan 28, 2020 1:04:26 GMT -5 by Johnny - Back to Top\\nsdw\\nsdw-Sharon and her mother\\nHistory of the Walton Family Apr 26, 2019 11:31:19 GMT -5 goldfinch1 and Johnny like this\\nPost by sdw on Apr 26, 2019 11:31:19 GMT -5\\nZadok what branch of The Waltons did Cora Beth Godsey come from.

Isn\\'t that swell?\\nAlso, this change in the comic will mark a change in approach. For a while I was keeping up a weekly schedule, but now I\\'m just going to update when I can. This is because I really want each comic to be the best I can make it, so to that end I won\\'t rush things out. I mean, it\\'s not like I\\'m getting paid, right? So there\\'s no point in rushing. But with that said, it\\'s probably more realistic to expect comics every two weeks as opposed to every week. That\\'s how it\\'s been for a while now anyway, so you should be used to it.\\nAt first this switchover was going to reflect my move to Japan with the characters going back to Japan as well. But since things are a little dicey over there at the moment, I\\'m still in the States.\\nNot much else to say.

I think that\\'s a bigger need than an outfielder or any other position player, but given that they\\'re reportedly in the market for both, it\\'s a good idea to take a look at both sides to see what else is out there. Up until a few days ago, I couldn\\'t see them acquiring an infielder because they seemed happy with what they\\'ve gotten from Whit Merrifield and are definitely happy with the contributions from Cheslor Cuthbert. Now, after Merrifield sat over the weekend, I\\'m not so sure. Anyway, without further ado, here\\'s a look at the position players the Royals could be looking toward on the trade market this month.\\nCarlos Beltran – This would be a pretty good story at the very least. There\\'s been rumors of Beltran\\'s return to the Royals since the offseason he signed with the Yankees, and there\\'s even more stories now about him coming back next year to take over the DH role. For now, though, the Royals have a need in the outfield where Beltran technically plays. His defense isn\\'t what you\\'d call good, which is kind of sad because we still remember him as one of the better center fielders, but he can stand out there, which is nice. He doesn\\'t work a walk like he used to, but he still has legitimate power and he\\'s not just a creation of Yankee Stadium. He hasn\\'t hit as many home runs away from there, but he\\'s hit well. This one makes some sense as he\\'s a pending free agent. He is owed about $7 million the rest of the year, so that may be an obstacle for the Royals.\\nCharlie Blackmon – It seems like Blackmon has been on the market for about 10 years, but that\\'s simply not true, so stop thinking it. He can hit, he can play a serviceable center field (but I think he\\'d be better in a corner in Kansas City) and he can give you some pop. There\\'s always a concern with Colorado guys, but Blackmon doesn\\'t have as big of a home/road split this year as you\\'d probably expect. He\\'s currently in his first year of arbitration and is owed a little more than $1.5 million the rest of this year before he has two more arbitration years coming up. My guess is those will cost about $16 million, but he could also be traded again. I think he\\'s going to cost a lot, but he could fill a void the Royals have had in right field for awhile and fill it for the next few seasons.\\nJay Bruce – This is another guy who has seemingly been on every trade list for years. He almost got traded before the season, but it was nixed by a bad physical by Michael Saunders. All Bruce has done is turn in one of the best offensive years of his career. He\\'s never going to be mistaken for a batting champ, but he\\'s hit much better this year and that\\'s made his OBP worthwhile. He doesn\\'t walk that much, but he does strike out less than you\\'d think (still a fair amount). One thing I liked about him last year that I like about him again is that he doesn\\'t make that much soft contact. I almost wonder if he\\'d be a better hitter in a bigger park because he has enough power to hit it out of every park. Getting some deeper gaps might help him out. It won\\'t help him defensively, though the scouting reports and the metrics disagree on Bruce. He\\'s owed about $6 million the rest of this season and there\\'s a $13 million option for next year. He\\'ll be in demand. This is a fit that I don\\'t think looks as good on paper as it would on the field, but I also think it\\'s a longshot given Bruce\\'s popularity in this market.\\nKole Calhoun – I\\'m not even sure if Calhoun gets traded, but as I mentioned when going over the pitchers, the Angels really need to regroup their farm system. Dealing Calhoun would make some sense, though it would probably weaken them even more than they\\'d prefer while they still have that Trout guy. Calhoun is a little like Alex Gordon. He plays excellent defense (in right field, though), works a walk and has some power. He doesn\\'t strike out quite as much as Gordon and he\\'s a few years younger, but they\\'re kind of similar to me. He\\'s due to make about $1.5 million the rest of this year and then has three more years of arbitration, so he won\\'t be cheap, costing presumably about $22-$25 million over those three seasons, but given the control, I\\'d be willing to give up a fair amount for Calhoun than some of the other rentals.\\nKhris Davis – I mentioned Davis before the season and before he was traded to the A\\'s, and here he is again. The game is power and that\\'s really about it. He doesn\\'t hit for much of an average and he doesn\\'t walk very much. But he does hit for power. Did I mention he has power? This is not a great option. He\\'s only played left field in the big leagues, and he doesn\\'t play it well. If anything, this would be a situation where the Royals could look to him to hold down right field and then shift to the DH spot next year. The A\\'s gave up a couple decent prospects to get him and would likely want at least that in return, which I don\\'t think is worth it personally.\\nCarlos Gonzalez – Here\\'s probably the best position player on the trade market, so that immediately puts the Royals at a disadvantage, though if the Rockies find themselves especially keen on someone like Jorge Bonifacio, I could see a deal finding its way to the surface. Coors Field makes Gonzalez a monster, but that doesn\\'t mean he isn\\'t a good player outside of there. He plays quality defense and can still hit enough to make a difference. The power doesn\\'t play nearly as well outside of Coors, but I still think he\\'s probably a 16-22 home run guy away from that great environment. He\\'s not cheap. He\\'s owed around $8 million the rest of this year and $20 million next year. I don\\'t see the Royals paying that or giving up a different prospect to get the Rockies to pay some of it, but he\\'s available, so here he is.\\nBrandon Guyer – I\\'m not a fan, but if the Rays are open for business, Guyer will draw some attention. He\\'s not especially good defensively and he\\'s not much of a hitter, but he gets on base using the skill of getting hit by a pitched baseball. I would imagine acquiring Guyer would be with the hopes of catching lightning in a bottle and him getting hot at the right time. Also, he probably wouldn\\'t cost too much to pick up. Plus, he actually does hit lefties very well, so that could be a fit for him with the Royals. He\\'s owed a bit more than $500k the rest of this year and then has two more years of arbitration. I could see a fit, I guess, but it would be a pretty meh acquisition.\\nNick Markakis – This right here might be my least favorite name on the list for the Royals to acquire unless it comes at basically no cost. He works walks, but that\\'s pretty much it at this point in his career. It\\'s not that the skill of working a walk isn\\'t valuable, but the Royals need more than that. This year, his average has plummeted and he still doesn\\'t have any power. Plus, he\\'s not especially good defensively anymore, and he is owed about $27 million more through 2018. Please don\\'t do this, Royals.\\nSteve Pearce – I wanted the Royals to sign Pearce as a platoon partner for Jarrod Dyson back in the winter, but they didn\\'t listen. He\\'s currently on the disabled list with a hamstring strain, but he was hitting .322/.393/.540 before getting hurt. Pearce can play outfield, first base and even a little second. You probably don\\'t want him playing second too often, but with his stick, against a good lefty, that could be worth it. Yes, he crushes lefties. He\\'s hitting .383/.473/.766 against them in 55 plate appearances. He\\'s just on a one-year deal and is owed a bit more than $2 million the rest of the way, but he could be a really nice fit.\\nJosh Reddick – I\\'m not sure a more perfect player has ever existed at the trade deadline for a team than Reddick for the Royals. They\\'re on the lookout for a lefty-hitting outfielder. Well, Reddick plays excellent defense in right field, hardly ever strikes out and actually works walks. He has power, but not as much as you\\'d probably like from your right fielder. Basically he\\'s about the best Royals fit in baseball and he doesn\\'t even play for the Royals. He\\'s also only owed a bit north of $3 million the rest of the season. That\\'s not to say he\\'s a perfect player. He really struggles against lefties and he\\'s already dealt with an injury this season. Still, picking up Reddick and slotting him into the second spot in the batting order could do wonders for this lineup. He\\'s a free agent after the season, so the cost may not be prohibitive, but he\\'ll also be coveted by many teams. This one is very interesting to me.\\nRickie Weeks – He was once a very good offensive second baseman for the Brewers, but fell on really hard times defensively and his offense declined to make him basically not playable at second. Now he\\'s an outfielder and after a rough go of it last year, he\\'s really picked things up and is now hitting decently for the Diamondbacks in a reserve role. The bad news is that his defense is pretty terrible. I don\\'t even think he\\'s a real option, but he\\'s owed next to nothing and the Diamondbacks would probably deal him, so why not include him?\\nGordon Beckham – You want a second baseman? This could be the best fit out there for the Royals. Beckham never really found it with the White Sox after a promising debut, but he\\'s doing a nice job in a utility role for the Braves. He works a walk, doesn\\'t strike out a ton and plays a decent second base. I\\'m not convinced he\\'s actually better than Merrifield, but he\\'s having a better year and is super cheap. I think he\\'d be a benefit to the Royals and can\\'t cost much in the way of prospects or money as he\\'s owed well less than $1 million the rest of the season.\\nAndres Blanco – Remember when Blanco was considered the shortstop of the future for the Royals and he was in the big leagues at the age of 20? Somehow he resurfaced with the Phillies a couple years ago and has been a valuable utility player for them. He\\'s seen time at every infield position and a little in the outfield as well. He\\'s not having nearly as good of a year offensively as he did last year and he\\'s not the defensive wizard he was coming through the Royals system, but he might be a nice fit as a utility guy in Kansas City. He\\'ll be a free agent after the season and isn\\'t making much money. Keep an eye on this one.\\nZack Cozart – This is an admittedly imperfect fit, but I\\'ve heard some things about the Royals having interest. Cozart is a fantastic defensive shortstop with some power that would actually play at Kauffman Stadium (just not as well as in his home bandbox, though he has more homers on the road). The reason it\\'s imperfect is that the Royals have a shortstop already and neither Cozart nor Escobar has much experience at second base, if any. Still, Cozart would add to the Royals lineup, so if they feel comfortable with moving one of the shortstops to the other side of the bag, they could have something. He\\'s signed cheaply this year with a little less than $1.5 million remaining and then has a year of arbitration left before hitting free agency. The demand for him isn\\'t as high as I would have thought, but he\\'s a solid player, so he won\\'t be able to be acquired cheaply. I don\\'t see it happening, but it\\'s an interesting name to think about.\\nDaniel Descalso – I\\'m not spending much time on this. He\\'s not especially good in any facet, but he\\'s hitting well this year and can play multiple positions. And he\\'s cheap. So there\\'s that.\\nYunel Escobar – The Royals don\\'t really need a third baseman or a shortstop and Escobar hasn\\'t played second base since 2007, but I\\'ve heard his name mentioned. He\\'s had a really nice season and does have a history with Dayton Moore as he was a part of the Braves organization way back then. If you feel comfortable putting him at second for two months, he could be a fit. I wouldn\\'t personally feel comfortable, but a guy who has hit well over .300 with a .370+ OBP since the start of last season isn\\'t something to turn your nose up at if he becomes available. He\\'s owed a little more than $3 million the rest of this season, though some of that is paid by Washington. He has a team option for $7 million next year. I don\\'t think he would require a huge haul, but I\\'m not sure why the Angels would trade him unless they get an offer that\\'s more than he\\'s worth.\\nJed Lowrie – You\\'re not acquiring Lowrie for his defense, but he can really help a lineup out. He\\'s a quality hitter who will work a walk. Strangely, his power has somewhat disappeared this year. He plays a nearly competent second base, but the offensive upgrade is something that I think would be well worth the risk on his defense. He\\'s owed about $3.5 million more this year and then is owed $6.5 million next year with a team option for $6 million. He\\'s not the perfect player for the Royals, but he could hold down second base for the rest of this year and into next year until Mondesi is ready when he can be used as trade bait again.\\nEduardo Nunez – This has been a breakout season for Nunez that hasn\\'t exactly come out of nowhere. It was easy to miss this last season, but Nunez was solid for the Twins last year as well. I\\'m not sure there\\'s a great fit here because he doesn\\'t play much second base, but if he could, this would make some sense. He doesn\\'t walk much, but he doesn\\'t strike out hardly at all either. He has tons of speed, so he might fit perfectly at the top of a Need Yost lineup. He\\'s very cheap and will be entering his final year of arbitration next season, so the Twins don\\'t have to move him because the return likely won\\'t be fantastic anyway, but he could be a fit.\\nYangervis Solarte – I don\\'t think anyone could have predicted that Solarte would have the season he\\'s had for the Padres. He\\'s played mostly third, but he has manned second a little bit this season. He\\'s not going to remind anyone of Roberto Alomar, but he isn\\'t going to kill you either. He can work a walk and doesn\\'t strike out much. He\\'s even developed a little power. He\\'d actually be a near perfect fit for the number two spot in the batting order, but could moonlight as a leadoff man. I think the Padres would ask a lot as he isn\\'t even arbitration eligible until next season. He did just turn 29, so there isn\\'t much additional upside, but he could be a nice plug and play option for the Royals for the next few seasons and, like Lowrie, give them a trade chip if everything works out with the guys already in the organization.\\nTags: Andres Blanco, Brandon Guyer, Carlos Beltran, Carlos Gonzalez, Charlie Blackmon, Daniel Descalso, Eduardo Nunez, Gordon Beckham, Jay Bruce, Jed Lowrie, Josh Reddick, Khris Davis, Kole Calhoun, Nick Markakis, Rickie Weeks, Steve Pearce, Yangervis Solarte, Yunel Escobar, Zack Cozart |\\nDavid Lesky\\nFollow @dblesky\\nI\\'ve been a Royals fan since the day I was born, and have had the opportunity to write about the Royals for nearly a decade now.

As of Thursday evening no other politicians had contacted him to ask him to step down, he said.\\nIf they do, he won\\'t.\\n\"I\\'m going to respond that my honesty and integrity in putting it out there is the best thing that could happen to the party,\" Cohen said in an interview with the Tribune, part of an effort to respond to growing calls among Democrats that he step aside and not risk dragging down Gov.

The allegations included him frightening their four children and threatening her verbally and physically.\\n\"It was a short period of time, and it\\'s certainly not something that the people of Illinois need to be concerned with,\" York-Cohen said.\\nUPDATED AT 6:22 p.m. with Cohen\\'s media blitz, divorce records.\\nThe Chicago pawnbroker who won the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor ramped up a media campaign this evening to defend himself in the face of growing pressure from party regulars to drop out as Gov. Pat Quinn\\'s running mate.\\nQuinn suggested Scott Lee Cohen should quit rather than risk dragging down the Democratic ticket in scandal over his background, including his 2005 arrest on misdemeanor domestic battery case involving an ex-girlfriend with a prostitution conviction. Other leading Illinois Democrats called on Cohen to quit, while acknowledging there may be little they can do legally to make it happen.\\nCohen said he had no intention of dropping out and was the victim of false allegations. But as Cohen sought to set the record straight, with his ex-wife at his side for media interviews, the records from his 2005 divorce case portrayed a troubled marriage.\\nIn the divorce records, Cohen\\'s ex-wife accused him of using illegal drugs, rages and abusive behavior, including choking her.\\n\"Over the past year my husband has been taking injectable anabolic steroids, including but not limited to Winstrol, Cretin, and Steen, and as a result he has an erratic, explosive temper,\" Cohen\\'s ex-wife, Debra York Cohen, said in a petition for an order of protection. She described rages at their children, his admission to several affairs, and alleged he tried to force himself on her sexually.\\nCohen responded to some of the allegations in his petition to visit his children during the couple\\'s separation.\\n\"Although I may have taken steroids and or performance enhancing drugs in the past I have not utilized any of these drugs in the last two weeks … Although from time to time I have screamed and yelled at my children, that is my parenting style and my prerogative. I have never abused my children, I have never hurt my children and I have never done any harm to them,\" Cohen said, according to the records.\\nThe divorce records contain a judicial order for Cohen to submit to periodic urine tests for drugs including steroids and other controlled substances. The divorce records also indicate money problems for the couple.\\nThe record contains a Sept. 8, 2006 letter from a mortgage company demanding $23,557.26 for unpaid payments on a $650,000 mortgage for the couple\\'s Northbrook home. The letter threatens foreclosure.\\nPosted by Monique Garcia, John Chase and Michelle Manchir at 12:05 p.m.; last updated at 3:37 p.m. with John Schmidt talking about 1986\\nThe Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor issued a statement today saying he has no intention of dropping out of the race, just hours after Gov. Pat Quinn said the Chicago pawnbroker should consider stepping aside for the good of the party\\'s ticket.\\nScott Lee Cohen said he wants his ex-girlfriend to talk about her prior complaint against him, which resulted in his 2005 arrest.\\nHere is the statement, issued through the public relations firm that assisted his campaign.\\n\"I have no intention of stepping down or stepping aside. When the facts come to light, after my ex-wife and ex-girlfriend speak, the people of Illinois can decide, and I will listen to them directly. I am asking my ex-wife and ex-girlfriend to come forward and to talk with the media.\\nThere are questions, and I will provide all answers honestly and openly. I only ask for time to do the interviews. 2005 was a difficult time in my life. I was going through a divorce, and I started running with a fast group. I was in a tumultuous relationship with the woman I was dating. We had a fight, but I never touched her. She called the police, however, she never came to court, and the charges were dismissed. I realized this relationship was not healthy, I ended it, and we parted amicably.\"\\nCohen then released a second statement: \"I tried to tell everyone about this early on. I wanted to talk about all of these issues, but everyone wrote me off, and said I didn\\'t have a chance to win. Now that I\\'m the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor, the day after the election, there are questions. I am happy to answer any and all questions; I just need time to do so.\"\\nCohen\\'s statements came after Quinn said today that his new running mate should consider withdrawing from the race because his background could hurt the Democratic ticket in the November general election.\\nCohen \"has an obligation to step aside\" if his past becomes a problem, Quinn said at a news conference.\\n\"I do believe that the person who\\'s had these matters brought up about himself should at least have a chance to talk about them to the public, but if his explanations are unsatisfactory, and so far they have been, then he has to do the appropriate thing,\" Quinn said.\\n\"Our country and our state are bigger than ourselves. The Democratic Party is bigger than me or any other candidate. If there are matters that are raised about your conduct that disqualify you from running in a proper way for an election in the fall, then the only appropriate thing is to step aside. And I think that\\'s what we\\'re looking at here.\"\\nQuinn did not say Cohen\\'s name once during the hour-long news conference.\\nQuinn also said he has spoken with Michael Madigan, the Illinois Democratic Party chairman and House speaker, about the process for finding a new lieutenant governor nominee should Cohen step down.\\n\"In those circumstances, then the state central committee has to come together and they have to select a replacement,\" Quinn said. \"Any of those who are interested in vying for something will have to wait.\"\\nQuinn also was asked if knew about Cohen\\'s problems beforehand.\\n\"No one in my campaign staff told me anything about it and I don\\'t think anybody knew about it, at least I didn\\'t,\" Quinn said. \"I had no idea of these matters and I learned reading the papers, watching TV. I consider them very, very serious and grave matters. I think any citizen would feel the same.\"\\nQuinn said it was not the job of the Democratic Party to vet Cohen, but rather the job of the voters.\\nWhile governor and lieutenant governor candidates run separately in the primary, some candidates pool resources and campaign as a team. The idea is that a governor candidate doesn\\'t want to get stuck with an undesirable running mate in the fall. Among Democrats, neither Quinn nor Hynes took a lieutenant governor candidate under their wings. On the Republican side, governor candidate Andy McKenna teamed up with lieutenant governor candidate Matt Murphy for campaigning purposes.\\nDemocrats might pressure Cohen to drop out, but it\\'s doubtful that they can outright force him off the statewide ticket as state law now exists. Democratic voters elected Cohen Tuesday after spent more than $2 million of his own money on his lieutenant governor bid. Cohen bested five other candidates, including some state lawmakers.\\nElection attorney Burt Odelson, who worked for Adlai Stevenson III\\'s gubernatorial campaign in 1986 when he was paired with an acolyte of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, said there is nothing in the election law that would allow Quinn or the Democratic Party to force Cohen off the ballot.\\n\"The Democrats and the Republicans are locked in,\" Odelson said. \"The governor and the lieutenant governor are tied together.\"\\nThe only way they can be split, Odelson said, is if Cohen withdraws or Quinn withdraws and formulates a separate party, like Stevenson did in the 1986 campaign he eventually lost.\\n\"This is a very unique situation. It\\'s another chapter in Chicago and Cook County and Illinois history,\" Odelson said.\\nJohn Schmidt, who was one of Stevenson\\'s attorneys in 1986, said he finds the situation Stevenson faced 24 years ago to be very similar to the Quinn is facing today.\\n\"Stevenson decided there was no way you run for governor and say vote for me and oh, by the way, you also should vote for this other guy,\" Schmidt said. Although they looked into trying to find ways to force LaRouche follower Mark Fairchild off the ballot, they discovered they couldn\\'t. So Stevenson eventually decided to withdraw as the Democratic nominee and launch the Solidarity Party.\\n\"Short of him talking Cohen into stepping down...I don\\'t see how you can run with him given what we\\'ve known,\" Schmidt said. \"A guy who was arrested for holding a knife to a woman\\'s neck?\"\\nAny efforts to try to pass a law in the General Assembly to negate the primary results, he said, \"would be unconstitutional on its face.\"\\n\"After you\\'ve been through a process to say we don\\'t like the guy who won and try to change the law? That just doesn\\'t work,\" he said.\\nHe said Quinn\\'s best defense from this hurting the Democratic ticket is for him to be clear with voters.\\n\"There\\'s a lot to be said with standing up and saying either Cohen gets off the ticket or I will run as an independent,\" Schmidt said.\\nQuinn was faced with the new crisis even as his rival, Dan Hynes, announced he was conceding the Democratic primary nomination for governor.\\nCohen, a pawnbroker who was the surprise winner in the little-publicized contest among half a dozen candidates, had previously disclosed his 2005 arrest. He described it Wednesday as an argument with his drunken girlfriend and said he didn\\'t lay a hand on her, though she called the police and had him taken into custody.\\nBut the official police and court records show that the woman alleged Cohen put a knife to her throat and pushed her head against the wall.\\nIn their October 14 arrest report detailing the complaint from the 24-year-old woman, Chicago police noted they observed \"mild abrasions from knife wound\" on her neck. They also noted \"minor scars on her hand from her trying to defend herself against the arrestee swinging the knife at her.\" The report notes the woman was seen by ambulance personnel but not taken to a hospital.\\nThe case was dropped a month later when the woman did not show up for a court date.\\nCohen won in large part because his self-financed campaign ran TV commercials late in the race showing him running job fairs to help the unemployed. He only garnered 212,900 votes but it helped him defeat opponents, including state Rep. Art Turner and state Sen. Terry Link.\\nA little more than a year after former Gov. Rod Blagojevich\\'s removal, the state\\'s Democratic powerbrokers focused much of their time, energy and money on the top tier race of governor, leaving the less-known lieutenant governor\\'s race to go well under the radar.\\nThe lack of a Democratic cohesive strategy leaves the party unclear of its options for the general election.\\nIt also adds yet another punchline on Illinois politics, which has been the focus of national jokes and derision since Blagojevich\\'s high-profile arrest, impeachment and indictment.\\nIn conceding the race this morning to Quinn, Hynes was asked how he\\'d feel if he had won and been paired with Cohen.\\n\"The first I learned of any of this was when I read the paper this morning,\" Hynes said. \"But we\\'re going to let that sort itself out, and figure out, you know, with more information. I think that some decisions will be made. But I\\'m not in a position to make those decisions, given the fact that I just learned about it this morning.\"\\nCohen is scheduled to appear on WTTW\\'s \"Chicago Tonight\" at 7 p.m.\\nIllinois Secretary of State Jesse White, who would have to appear on the statewide ticket this fall with Cohen, echoed Quinn\\'s comments.\\n\"We would agree with the governor that Mr. Cohen needs to explain himself,\" White said in a statement. \"He needs to address these issues, and if he can\\'t adequately, then he should consider strongly getting out.\"\\nPosted at 12:05:12 PM in 2010 Illinois election, 2010 Illinois Governor\\'s race, 2010 Illinois Lieutenant Governor\\'s race\\nIt\\'s just so sad how ineffective the Tribune endorsements are.

Those were, indeed, the years when the long P trademark began to develop, thanks also to Marcello Dudovich, Plinio Codognato and Leonardo Cappiello.\\nIn the years between the wars, the Pirelli Group communication began spreading all around the world. The trend reached full bloom in the 1950s and 1960s, when the best European designers congregated at Pirelli: Max Huber, Pavel M. Engelmann, Bob Noorda, Albe Steiner, and Raymond Savignac; among the Italian designers, Bruno Munari, Armando Testa, Riccardo Manzi, Giulio Confalonieri, and Pino Tovaglia.\\nThese are also the years of the Pirelli magazine, where articles of Ungaretti, Montale, Sciascia and Eco appeared, accompanied by Renato Guttuso illustrations.\\nMoreover, Pirelli also started a great cinematographic tradition, to boast in the two most typical channels of corporate communication, documentary and advertising films, which dates back to as early as the Twenties and Thirties.\\n(source: Pirelli)\\nMay 1910 Touring Club ad.\\n1914 Pneus Touring ad.\\n1916 Tacchi Stella Nino Nanni ad.\\n1917 Roowy Neu-Pirelli ad.\\n1917 Pneus Plinio Podognato ad.\\n1921 Dudovich Lidel ad.\\n1948 Scopinich Camminate ad.\\n1953 Raymond Savignac Borse ad.\\n1953 Ascari ad.\\n1955 Armando Testa Atlante ad.\\nPirelli Stella Bianca.\\nSince 1890, Pirelli has been synonymous with high-performance tires. With the creation of the Ercole, which marked the start of a long history of sporting success, the excellence of Pirelli\\'s products has been the concrete and visible result of the constant improvement of production processes, design methods and the use of materials.\\nFrom the Ercole to the pre-war Stella Bianca; from the Stelvio, workhorse of the motorised masses, to the innovative Cinturato of the 1950s to today\\'s ultra-high-performance \"run flat\" models outfitted with pressure sensors: the history of product innovation at Pirelli is an impressively long one.\\nPirelli Stella Bianca advertising.\\nThe Pirelli Cinturato.\\nAppearing for the first time in Pirelli advertising towards the mid-Fifties, its debut together with its stablemates the Stelvio and the Rolle was somewhat muted. Almost as if it was nothing more than another new product in the broad \"Alpino\" range of Pirelli tyres (that also included the Cisa and the Sempione). Subdued, with no underlining of its diversity. Which in truth was overwhelming…\\nPirelli\\'s approach to the fabric radial was known as the Cinturato or \"Belted\", after the fabric plies that effectively belted the radial carcass.\\nThe fabric Cinturato - it had yet to be equipped with steel belts - was invented around 1951 and cautiously introduced to the market a couple of years later.\\n\"Cautiously\" because for the requirements of the average driver in the 1950s, the Cinturato was if anything too \"advanced\": much stiffer than conventional cross-ply tyres, it permitted exceptional roadholding even at high speed, although it did penalize comfort.\\nIt was at least partly for this reason that Cinturato advertising of the time exclusively targeted sports cars and those drivers for whom speed and handling outweighed any bumps.\\nIn 1955 it was in fact \"the tyre for the Lancia Aurelia\" or \"for the Alfa Romeos\": its sporting character had already been forged.\\nIn the late Fifties and early Sixties, the Cinturato gradually became known as \"the safest tyre for the most powerful cars\", the one that \"defeats centrifugal force\" and that guarantees \"cornering safety\". And later it was also the tyre \"for elegant cars\".\\nA high-end positioning that was graphically emphasised by the magnificent advertising campaign photographed by Mulas in 1962, in which the tyre was once again paired with the female figure, as in the era of Dudovich.\\nHowever, Mulas\\'s absorbed and self-possessed girls actually seem to suggest a new key to the reading of the Cinturato product image: no longer was it just about speed and power - male myths - but now also comprised safety and reliability, aspects appealing to the first generations of young female drivers…By no means coincidentally, Mulas\\'s advertising campaign also included the \"Sempione Safety Shoulder\", the more reliable version of the conventional Sempione cross-ply range.\\nSo as to avoid over-emphasising the safety aspect of the Cinturato at the expense of its sporting image, in 1965 Mulas trained his lenses on Juan Manuel Fangio too. \"I once raced with the Pirelli Stelvio\", said the Argentine World Champion in the advertising copy, \"Today I\\'ve got the Cinturato on my car. It\\'s a tyre that\\'s truly different to the others. What\\'s most surprising is the absolute driving precision. Extraordinary\". The talented Riccardo Manzi was to return to the safety theme once more the following year for the \"Andiamo sul sicuro\" or \"Let\\'s go for safety\" campaign, and he was himself followed by another genius (two geniuses in fact: as Arrigo Castellani was also involved): Pino Tovaglia who emphasised the Cinturato\\'s dual nature with the \"Un viaggio ma\" or \"A trip but\" campaign highlighting the close ties between the pleasure of sporting driving and the tranquillity of absolute safety.\\nPirelli Cinturato advertising.\\nPirelli old logo.\\nPirelli logo.

Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) is the government\\'s tax relief for investments into social enterprises. Business Property Relief (BPR) supports business investment generally by providing a potential shelter from Inheritance Tax.\\nFollowing the financial crisis in 2008 and the lack of bank finance subsequently available, many small and medium sized companies have had to look elsewhere for funding.\\nWhen the world\\'s bourses are collapsing, as happened in the last recession, the valuations of unquoted companies can hold up well against general trends.\\nIf and when the economy bounces back from recession, small companies can be the quickest to react, expanding rapidly, and seizing market share.\\nInvesting early can give spectacular returns because small companies can quickly multiply in size.\\nIndividuals are able to support social enterprises and receive incentives for doing so.\\nThe underlying sectors, styles and strategies of investment represent a broad range of opportunities, and the available tax benefits are designed to help mitigate the risk of investing in such companies. The following pages explain these government incentives in more detail, from their structure to their associated tax benefits.\\nThe following pages refer mainly to five types of investment vehicles: SEIS, EIS, VCT, SITR and BPR and are an outline of the various schemes. This should not be used as a means of proceeding with an investment, since it is not a comprehensive summation of the rules; investors should seek expert, independent professional advice.

However, more recently, this exceptionally complex disease continuum has primarily come to be defined by its biological manifestations.\\nCharacterizing the disease by its biology allows for more consistent characterization and facilitates a better understanding of the disease and its mechanisms 1. Additionally, it also offers better accuracy in clinical trials 1.\\nWith the transition towards precision and personalized medicine, in the area of AD, biomarkers are critical. Biomarkers associated with the specific states and stages of the disease at an individual level are necessary to provide the best patient management options. They are also needed as clinical trial endpoints to help develop an understanding of this complex disease.\\nDue to the rigorous search for useful AD biomarkers and general central nervous system diseases, the race towards confirming new biomarkers in these indications is a fast-moving and stimulating task.\\nThis article discusses current, non-invasive biomarkers and investigational biomarkers for the research and diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease, as well as clinical trial partner proficiencies that may be useful along the path of development.\\nCurrently established Alzheimer\\'s disease biomarkers for early diagnosis and clinical trials\\nIt is recognized that biological signs of AD appear 15 to 20 years prior to the first clinical symptoms, as levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau peptides build up in the brain. These aggregates set off intracellular signaling that results in apoptosis.\\nThe central cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of neuronal degeneration include:\\nBeta-amyloid 42 protein (Aβ42)\\nPhosphorylated tau protein (p-tau)\\nTotal tau protein (t-tau)\\nCSF levels of these three biomarkers can precisely stage the disease. Imaging studies are also utilized for the diagnosis of AD: MRI has the capacity to detect Beta-amyloid aggregation and cortical atrophy. Specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiotracers facilitates visualization of both tau-protein tangles and β-amyloid plaques in vivo 2.\\nIn short, the current blended approach utilized in the differential diagnosis and confirmation of AD and during clinical trial evaluations may include:\\nBiomarkers in CSF\\nAlthough imaging and CSF biomarker studies like this have the capacity to catch AD in the presymptomatic phase – 15 to 20 years before the onset of symptoms – they are extremely invasive, expensive and unable to be used as screening tests. When patients do eventually present symptoms, they are already cognitively impaired.\\nWhile effective therapies are not yet available, there is evidence to suggest that incorporating of early lifestyle interventions can prevent the onset of dementia in predisposed individuals 3-4.\\nFor clinical trial and screening qualification, viable early screening tests are an absolute necessity.\\nDeveloping blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer\\'s disease\\nAs of yet, no standard clinical diagnostic techniques are available for the diagnosis of AD from blood samples. Yet, a significant number of continuing studies and recent publications are focused on promising blood biomarkers for this goal.\\nP-tau 181: An ultrasensitive blood immunoassay showed that plasma p-tau 181 levels were linked with the degree of tau and β-amyloid pathologies and differentiated AD from other neurodegenerative disorders 5. Numerous other studies awaiting publication agree.\\nβ-amyloid 42/40: An immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay displayed that plasma Aβ42/ Aβ40, especially when combined with age and apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) status (see below), diagnosed brain amyloidosis accurately (confirmed by PET), even in individuals that were cognitively normal 6.\\nAβ42 and t-tau: An immunomagnetic reduction assay in a small study of patients with mild cognitive impairment indicated that elevated plasma Aβ42 and t-tau levels are related to later cognitive decline 7.\\nNeurofilament light chain (NfL): Concentrations of plasma NfL were seen to link with degree of neurodegeneration in Aβ+ subjects, as demonstrated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in PET imaging 8.\\nAssays with the sensitivity to detect these biomarkers at extremely low concentrations in the blood are expected to aid the clinical diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer\\'s disease through a simple blood test.\\nA research lab with a history of pioneering and early-stage implementation of non-invasive biomarker techniques is likely to offer drug developers the essential services for effective transition from bench to market.\\nExperts with both extensive and practical, collaborative research experience; Standard and complicated testing methods, and teams specifically committed to validating and translating new biomarkers from bench to market are all vital for the successful biomarker and companion diagnostic development to assist in clinical trials.\\nImage Credit: Cerba Research\\nGenetics presents additional biomarkers for AD diagnosis and research\\nAcquiring as much knowledge about a disease can produce additional predictive biomarkers and reveal therapeutic opportunities by distinguishing disease causes, mechanisms and characteristic progression.\\nAlthough AD is largely sporadic, recent genomic studies across vast cohorts have detected a number of genetic associations for the disease. Biomarker changes in these heritable forms of AD are typically similar to those for intermittent AD 9.\\nFor instance, an autosomal dominant, early-onset form of AD contains a genetic mutation that influences signaling at the neuronal level. Particularly, affected genes code for presynaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin and presenilin, an accelerator when converting amyloid protein precursor (APP) to amyloid β-protein 10.\\nThe awareness of this makes these proteins biomarker candidates for general AD.\\nAn additional example of a genetic biomarker for AD, the various APOE polymorphs ε2, ε3, and ε4 are related to differing concentrations of CSF Aβ42. The APOE genotype influences a patient\\'s risk factor for developing AD.\\nPatients with the ε4 allele demonstrate earlier declines in CSF Aβ42 concentrations, analogous to earlier amyloid deposition. The enhanced risk is greatest in homozygous ε4 carriers but is also raised in carriers of heterozygous ε4 11.\\nGenetics-driven biomarker discovery for AD is still a work in process, with a recent genome-wide meta-analysis verifying 20 known high-risk loci while determining five new ones, clearing a path for future investigations 12.\\nInvolved pathways were affiliated with immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins and APP metabolism, reflecting the complex nature of Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\nMultiomics approach to biomarker discovery\\nNo individual biomarker is inclined to serves as the signature for a disease as complex as AD. Complete characterization of the disease may necessitate incorporation, not only of genomics factors but also proteomics factors, lipidomics, transcriptomics factors and metabolomics factors, all working together.\\nA team with a high degree of skill and an expert technical platform are necessary for the integration of all the individual components of metabolic survey research into a full and clinically relevant profile.\\nCNS biomarkers for other diseases\\nDifferential diagnosis among neurodegenerative diseases can be a challenge when cognitive and clinical tests are deemed to be inconclusive.\\nSpecial biomarkers can also assist such cases as well. For example, in the lack of biomarkers for AD, an increase in special biomarker studies of CSF protein 40-3-3 can indicate accelerated progressive dementias from cerebral injury or prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob (CJD).\\nTo validate a diagnosis of CJD, cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion is an extremely sensitive and special test for the presence of protease-resistant prion protein 13.\\nFuture diagnostic profiling, research tools and therapeutic developments\\nThrough a mixture of metabolomics, genomics and proteomics, biomarker profiles of patients prone to developing AD can be generated. Simultaneously, clinical research diagnostics can be advanced to better explain the dysfunctional pathways leading to AD brain pathology in combination with corresponding therapeutic targets.\\nEventually, gene therapies – potentially RNA interference techniques – may be designed to limit the level of amyloid precursor protein gene expression in these patients to delay or prevent the onset of Down\\'s symptoms.\\nNon-invasive biomarkers for Alzheimer\\'s disease will help with prevention soon and therapies later\\nAs the global population is ever-aging, reducing the incidence of Alzheimer\\'s disease is currently a research priority. In the near future, innovative, non-invasive AD biomarkers may be available for prevention screening and to support clinical research.\\nIt is possible to incorporate quantification of plasma tau, β-amyloid, and neurofilament concentrations into this blood-based biomarker testing method.\\nDeveloping effective biomarkers that facilitate the development of precision medicine and personalized medicine requires genuine expertise across a spectrum of specialties from proteomics, to genetics, to metabolomics. It also demands experienced assistance in biomarker validation and planning.\\nBiomarker studies and multiomics profiling will offer a better understanding of Alzheimer\\'s disease, help establish new therapeutic agents and enable the implementation of preventive interventions well before the onset of this devastating and widespread disease.\\nJack CR Jr et al, NIA-AA Research framework: Toward a biological definition of Alzheimer\\'s disease, Alzheimer\\'s Dement 14(4):535-62, 2018\\nLa Joie R et al, Prospective longitudinal atrophy in Alzheimer\\'s disease correlates with the intensity and topography of baseline tauPET, Sci Transl Med 12(524): eaau5,732, 2020\\nSabia S et al, Association of ideal cardiovascular health at age 50 with incidence of dementia: 25- year follow-up of Whitehall II cohort study, BMJ 366: ppl4,414, 2019\\nLefèvre-Arbogast S et al, Nutrition and Metabolic Profiles in the Natural History of Dementia: Recent Insights from Systems Biology and Life Course Epidemiology, Curr Nutr Rep 8(3): pp256-69, 2019\\nKarikari TK et al, Blood phosphorylated tau 181 as a biomarker for Alzheimer\\'s disease: a diagnostic performance and prediction modelling study using data from four prospective cohorts, Lancet Neurol 19(5): pp422-33, 2020\\nSchindler SE et al, High-precision plasma β-amyloid 42/40 predicts current and future brain amyloidosis, Neurology 93(17): e1,647-e59, 2019\\nChen T et al, Plasma Aβ42 and Total Tau Predict Cognitive Decline in Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, Nature Sci Rep 9(1): p13,984, 2019\\nBenedet AL et al, Plasma neurofilament light associates with Alzheimer\\'s disease metabolic decline in amyloid-positive individuals, Alzheimer\\'s Dement (Amst) 11: pp679-89, 2019\\nLista S et al, Biomarkers in sporadic and familial Alzheimer\\'s disease, J Alzheimer\\'s Dis 47(2): pp291-317, 2015\\nÖhrfelt A et al, The presynaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin is a novel biomarker for Alzheimer\\'s disease, Alzheimer\\'s Res Ther 8(1): p41, 2016\\nLautner R et al, Preclinical effects of APOE ε4 on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 concentrations, Alz Res Ther 9: p87, 2017\\nKunkle BW et al, Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer\\'s disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Aβ, tau, immunity and lipid processing, Nat Genet 51(3): pp414-30, 2019\\nFiorini M et al, High diagnostic accuracy of RT-QuIC assay in a prospective study of patients with suspected sCJD, Int J Mol Sci 21(3): p880, 2020\\nBallard C et al, Dementia in Down\\'s syndrome, Lancet Neurol 15(6): pp622-36, 2016\\nAbout Cerba Research\\nFor over 35 years, Cerba Research has been setting the industry standard for exemplary clinical trial conduct.

The facial expressions in her work were sublime, each one subtly representing a different emotion or mental state. This is the core of Lia\\'s work. Through her art, Lia manages to portray different emotions perfectly, and hence conjure them in her audience. Lia\\'s work isn\\'t strictly about technique, style or even color; it\\'s about feeling.\\nLia García is a painter and visual artist from the Dominican Republic. She recently graduated from Manhattanville College in New York, where she majored in Studio Art and Sociology while minoring in French Studies and Visual Arts Education. Throughout her college career, I had the privilege of watching Lia\\'s evolution as an artist. I got to see how her style, technique and subject matter changed. Most of all, I got to see how little by little Lia became more comfortable with her work. Her most recent pieces have focused mainly on portraiture, further expanding on the idea of portraying feelings and emotions through simple facial expressions. During her time in New York, Lia got the chance to participate in various exhibitions, where her paintings were acclaimed by many viewers, critics and collectors.\\nThroughout her career as a young artist, Lia has managed to accomplish something very impressive: she has developed a style that is completely recognizable. It isn\\'t often that we see such a young artist display such mastery over technique and format, and that\\'s what makes Lia such a remarkable young talent. Not only did she find a style that she was comfortable with, but she managed to adapt the style to her own judgement, instead of the other way around.\\nMost recently, Lia decided to move back to the Dominican Republic, where she\\'s been re-descovering her roots and adapting her acquired experience in New York to her original setting. Here at the Pyramid we\\'re very excited to see how this change of setting will affect Lia\\'s art and her process, but we\\'re sure that whatever she creates will be amazing, just like all of her work has been so far.\\n\"MY Red Underwear\" June 2019\\nOil on Canvas (16 x 20 inches)\\new recently got a chance to ask Lia a couple of questions in which we touched on her inspirations, her technique, her development as an artist and her creative process. This is what she had to say:\\nFirstly, I\\'d like to talk a little bit about your beginnings in art. When did you first discover that you were interested in being an artist? Did the desire to be an artist come first, or was it a result of your interest in expressing yourself creatively?\\nHonestly, I just always thought all kids did art when they were kids. It wasn\\'t until high school that I realized not everyone spent their childhood afternoons painting, or that not everyone did it after growing up as a \"hobby\", like I used to. You know that age when kids start getting an identity based on what they like to do? Like \\'the gymnast\\', or \\'the writer\\', or \\'the one who\\'s good at math\\'? One day I was suddenly \\'the artist\\' amongst my friends because it\\'s what I was good at. So, to answer your question, I guess it came as a result, but it wasn\\'t self-appointed. As a kid, it\\'s not like I\\'ve always wanted to be an artist. Even in college, the fact that I didn\\'t go to art school, or that I chose -at first- not to add studio art as a second major was a surprise to a lot of people, but here we are.\\n\"I just always thought all kids did art when they were kids. It wasn\\'t until high school that I realized not everyone spent their childhood afternoons painting.\"\\n\"Untitled\" October 2018\\nOil on Fabriano\\nMost of your work is based on portraiture, even though the technique you apply isn\\'t what is normally used for the types of paintings you paint. Why did you become interested in portraiture specifically?\\nI just love faces! Faces tell you so much about what people are feeling through their expressions. And the fact that everyone has a different face? Amazing. I wish I could paint every single face I\\'ve ever seen. Although, for the longest time, I used to only do self-portraits. The idea of painting someone else\\'s face scared me because I doubted I could do it, since the only reason I can so easily paint my own face is because it\\'s the face I know best and the one I study the most. Because its mine! (and because I spend a lot of time looking at it in the mirror). But, the night of my first solo show in New York two years ago, after my boyfriend at the time ----who\\'s face I used to paint a lot, too--, and I finished setting everything up and were waiting for guests to arrive, I realized the room was filled with paintings of mostly MY FACE. And even though my narcissistic tendencies didn\\'t really mind it, everything else in me absolutely hated it. So, after that, I forced myself to paint other faces than my own.\\n\"Faces tell you so much about what people are feeling through their expressions. And the fact that everyone has a different face? Amazing.\"\\n\"Guy with Pink around his eye\" December 2018\\nOil on Fabriano (8.5 x 11 inches)\\nThe technique that you use focuses heavily on impasto, which in my opinion gives your work an edge in which the focus of the paintings isn\\'t solely the subject matter, but also the style as well. This impasto technique, did it come before the idea of painting portraits, or is it a result of the decision to focus on portraiture?\\nImpasto! That word has been on the tip of my tongue for over a week, thanks! I started using this technique only about two years ago, so it came after. I was living in France for six months and only had dried-up paint brushes with me, and if you know me, you know that I am so lazy that I would rather use those paint brushes until they fall apart in my hands rather than buying new ones. Impasto comes out better if you don\\'t have a \"good\" brush in my opinion, so I started playing with this technique as an adaptation of my laziness. For a good amount of time I had been trying to reach a certain level of realism, got fairly good at it, and then got bored of it. This was just a few months after my first show in NY, and I was going through a self-discovery and artistic reinvention phase. My parents always tell me that my career as an artist is still pretty young and that I am free to change my style and approach any time I feel like it in order to find my signature. With impasto, I\\'m still doing portraits, only a little less personal, a little less real.\\n\"For a good amount of time I had been trying to reach a certain level of realism, got fairly good at it, and then got bored of it.\"\\n\"Picasso helped me be okay with not having just one style of painting. And Van Gogh\\'s work helped me fall in love with the primitiveness of the paint itself.\"\\nBeing in France for those months gave me a new perspective on art and the importance of sometimes letting go of perfectionism while at the same time putting more effort on technique. I got really close to Picasso and Van Gogh\\'s work. Picasso helped me be okay with not having just one style of painting. And Van Gogh\\'s work helped me fall in love with the primitiveness of the paint itself. Eventually, for a little while, I started moving away from portraits, I was painting more hands because they were less detailed and made it easier for me to transition from blending a lot to not blending at all. At first, I was very unsatisfied with my work, as usual. But it was all part of the process. Now I\\'m still doing portraits, and I\\'m still using the impasto technique in different forms, and I love the freedom it gives me.\\n\"Ojalá que llueva Café en el Campo\" June 2019\\nI\\'ve noticed that many of your paintings carry an emotional connotation to them. Many of your portraits portray not only a face, but also a specific feeling behind the expressions. Do you feel that the particular emotion that you are trying to present is important to the process you employ to create a painting? In other words, do the feelings expressed by the subjects in your paintings affect the way you decide to paint them, be it in color palette, style, or any other way?\\nI recently finished a series on facial expressions where I asked some of my social media followers to send me pictures of their face expressing any feeling and tell me what they were feeling and why, and then I painted them. The purpose of this was to shed light to some feelings we don\\'t usually talk about because they\\'re either too small and deemed insignificant, or too big and touchy to talk about. I think all feelings should be talked about, or at least expressed in some form. I don\\'t think, or at least I don\\'t do it consciously if at all, that the feeling described by the subjects affected the color palette or style. I try not to get too creative when I\\'m painting other people\\'s faces out of fear that they won\\'t recognize it, or it won\\'t resemble the reference picture. But, outside of this specific series, yes, my paintings have a lot of emotion behind it, I think primarily through the eyes. My grandma says that in a way, every portrait I paint of other people has a little bit of me in them. This is because I paint my own eyes on almost every piece, I think I have very expressive eyes, and I think it\\'s a way of channeling my own emotions through painting without necessarily painting my face over and over again.\\n\"I think all feelings should be talked about,\\nor at least expressed in some form.\"\\n\"Untitled\" January 2020\\nThese last few years you\\'ve been living in New York. In my opinion, NYC has a very deep influence in many creatives who are exposed to the artistic culture that the city possesses. Do you feel that being exposed to NYC and its art scene has affected the way you view your work and your process? If so, how exactly has it affected you as a creative?\\nYes! Definitely! I\\'ve met more artists and seen more art in my last four years in NYC than I have in my whole 22 years elsewhere. The city itself is a huge outdoor museum. I love it. I miss it so much. What I like the most about it is how quick people in New York are to call themselves artists. Over there, EVERYTHING is art! There are no rules or guidelines, if you consider it art, its art. I am very hard on myself and my work sometimes, but New York and the people there gave my work enough validation to help myself fall in love with it, too. It helped be accept every failed piece as simply part of the process, which is very hard to do when you\\'re someone who gets easily unmotivated every time something doesn\\'t go as planned.\\n\"What I like the most about it is how quick people in New York are to call themselves artists. Over there, EVERYTHING is art! There are no rules or guidelines, if you consider it art, its art.\"\\n\"Hands Up\" June 2019\\nThe art world in the Dominican Republic and New York is very different in terms which artists one is exposed to. Do you feel that painting in the DR and painting in NYC is somehow different? Is there a difference in your creative process in the two places, or is your creative process entirely dependent on you as an artist, and your vision for your work?\\nMmmmmm tough question, I truly don\\'t know how to answer. I\\'m with you, they are different, but I can\\'t pinpoint exactly how. I think maybe the process is altered by the environment. When I\\'m in DR, I live with my family, I don\\'t have my very own space, and 50% of my family is allergic to the smell of oils, so it\\'s tricky. Yet, I feel that my creativity is at an all-time high when I\\'m home, especially now during quarantine, and I end up producing a lot more than when I\\'m in NY. In NY I mostly live alone, and all the space is for me and my art, yet it takes longer for me to finish something or to start new projects, probably because I\\'m usually busy and rushing through things, and inspired by too many things that I get overwhelmed. I experience more artists block when I\\'m in NY than when I\\'m in DR. But I think people in NY interpret my work more accurately than the audience I have in DR.\\n\"I experience more artist\\'s block when I\\'m in NY than when\\nI\\'m in DR. But I think people in NY interpret my work more\\naccurately than the audience I have in DR.\"\\nYour work as a painter is, in my opinion, very impressive. I feel it\\'s admirable that at such a young age you\\'ve already developed such a particular and recognizable style. However, I feel that many creatives feel an inherent need to express themselves in any way possible. With this in mind, are there any other artistic mediums that you\\'d be interested in exploring in the future other than painting?\\nWow thank you! Yes, a lot, haha. I\\'m really into pottery lately, I think a lot of artists are doing really cool things… I was very into 3D printing a few years ago, and into printmaking and serigraphy... I love arts and crafts, especially when it\\'s focused on creating sustainable art. I used to make my own recycled paper and even made a few sketchbooks with it. I also love film, I\\'m not good at it, but it\\'s something I would want to explore. Graphic design... Sculpture, too… Illustration… Embroidery! En fin, so many things.\\n\"I love arts and crafts, especially when it\\'s\\nfocused on creating sustainable art.\"\\n\"Untitled\" June 2019\\nI\\'ve noticed that in most cases, artists have two different goals in mind when working on their pieces. Some artists hope that when people see their work, a certain idea is transmitted to them. Other artists simply create what they feel they need to express, and don\\'t really think about what others will understand through their work. In your case, is there a certain idea that you wish your work transmitted to viewers, or do you leave the interpretation of your work open to the viewers themselves?\\nThere\\'s always a meaning behind my pieces, I have something to say about almost each one. Yet, I leave it up to interpretation, mainly because I\\'m very shy haha. But I also almost never get asked the right questions during my shows, and I don\\'t like to get into it unless I\\'m asked. Sometimes I wish I could interview myself just so I can say what I want about each piece, but that makes very little sense to me. Maybe there\\'s not much to interpret or ask about, maybe the messages are clear enough. Or maybe they\\'re so unclear people just think there is no message. I don\\'t know, but frankly I don\\'t really mind if people interpret the wrong thing or don\\'t interpret anything at all. I\\'m okay with being the only one knowing the meaning behind my work. I think if you get it, you really get it, if you don\\'t (or don\\'t think there\\'s anything to get), it\\'s not for you and that\\'s okay, you know? There\\'s a lot of sociopolitical hidden context in my art, I\\'m a sociologist before I\\'m an artist. But not everyone sees it, or not everyone wants to see it, or maybe they just don\\'t want to ask about it. But it\\'s all part of the message I\\'m trying to communicate. I also don\\'t think there\\'s anything wrong with appreciating art solely for aesthetic purposes, but there is always a meaning or message behind what I produce.\\n\"There\\'s a lot of sociopolitical hidden context in my art, I\\'m a sociologist before I\\'m an artist.\"\\n\"I think if you get it, you really get it, if you don\\'t (or don\\'t think there\\'s anything to get), it\\'s not for you and that\\'s okay, you know?\"\\nFinally, is there any artist, from any medium, that you feel everyone should know? If so, who would that be and why?\\nOhhhhhhh there are so many I want to mention. But if I had to choose just one to help you understand me as an artist a little more, I would say Egon Schiele. He\\'s one of my favorite artists. Not only because the way he depicts the distorted human body and face resembles with me and my art, but also because I think we share a lot of the same rebellious tendencies without explanation through our art. There\\'s also a little of him in all of his pieces even when he\\'s not painting himself, and I relate to that.\\n\"Self-Portrait with Chinese Lantern Plant\"\\nby Egon Schiele\\new\\'d like to give a special thanks to Lia for taking the\\ntime to talk to us and answer our questions.

The majority of Park Homes are classified under Band A, the cheapest banding. However, if in doubt please check with the local Council.\\nAre children allowed on the parks?\\nOur Parks are specifically designed for the semi retired and retired with a minimum acceptable age of 50 years – on Acresfield Park the minimum acceptable age is 55. Children are always welcome to visit but are not allowed to live permanently on these Parks.\\nDo park homes retain their value?\\nProviding a Park Home, similar to any traditionally built home, is looked after and well maintained there is no reason why homes will not retain their value. Park Home values generally follow the trends of the general Housing Market.\\nWhat is the monthly pitch fee and how much can I expect to pay?\\nEvery Park charges a Pitch Fee. This monthly fee takes into account many things including a ground rent for keeping your home on a particular plot, the maintenance of communal areas on the Park including roadways and streetlighting, staffing, third party liability insurance, the list goes on. Typically the monthly charges range from £125 to £205. For Wyre Vale Park and Lodge Park the pitch fees include the water rates but excludes the sewerage rates which are payable to United Utilities. For Gawthorpe Edge Park and Acresfield Park United Utilities bill the homeowners directly for both water and sewerage services.\\nHow are the pitch fee charges reviewed?\\nThe review date for each Park may be different. The precise date will appear within the Park Agreement. The review process is strictly regulated. In general pitch fees are reviewed annually and increase or decrease in line with the Retail Prices Index.\\nOn all of our Residential Parks mains gas is available and homeowners are free to nominate the supplier of their choice. This is the same for electricity on all of our Parks except Lodge Park where the electricity is sub metered. Electricity on Lodge Park is supplied at cost and at a very competitive rate.\\nWhat is the expected life span of a park home?\\nAll modern Residential Parks Homes are built to British Standard 3632. Newly manufactured Park Homes exceed the energy rating of most standard traditionally built properties.\\nDo I have to upgrade my home after so many years?\\nNo. This rule relates to Parks with licences for holiday use and not residential. Under government legislation homeowners who live on Residential Park Home Estates are afforded security of tenure for an unlimited period if the Park is freehold. All of our Parks are freehold. You cannot be forced to upgrade.\\nAre their specialist Insurers who cover park homes?\\nYes, there are, one of which is Park Home Assist.\\nIs finance available for purchase of a park home?\\nThere are companies who finance both new and previously owned homes. A repayment calculator is available below. However there are other options to consider such as Part Exchange or Assisted Move Schemes.\\nDo we pay stamp duty when buying a park home?\\nPark Rules are there to ensure the good management of a Park and to ensure the health and wellbeing of all of the homeowners who live there.\\nWhat is the written statement and how does it affect me?\\nThe Written Statement under the Mobile Homes Act, known by many as The Park Agreement includes the provision of security of tenure for the homeowner/s and sets out the Park Owner\\'s obligations to the homeowner/s and their obligations to the Park Owner/s. This is a very important document. Owners on holiday parks do not have the benefit of these provisions which are important to secure and enhance your investment.\\nIs there a commission to pay when a home is re-sold?\\nYes. Under the Terms of the Mobile Homes Act 1983 the government brought in the commission payment scheme as a way of ensuring that pitch fees payable on Parks were kept to affordable levels. The maximum charge is 10% of the full sale price.\\nYou may move onto any of the Parks with not more than two dogs, or two cats or one dog and one cat—the dogs must not be of any of the breeds subject to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991—plus any pets or animals which are housed within a cage, aquarium or similar and which remain at all times within your home.

So it\\'s only natural they get their own collection. The original 1990 film is heavily represented here. But the cartoons get a chance to shine as well…\\nBebop & Rocksteady by Tim Rodilosso\\nLeonardo by Matthew Cohen.\\nDonatello by morphingtom2.0.\\nTurtles and Mr. Miyagi by noserain.\\nShredder by encoreunclic.\\nTMNT by un1cornwarrior.\\nEmail Rob at primaryignition@yahoo.com, or check us out on Twitter.\\nPosted in Comic Books/Graphic Novels, Weekly Comic 100s\\nWeekly Comic 100s: Superman, TMNT, Something is Killing the Children, and More!\\n***\"Weekly Comic 100s\" keeps it nice and simple. Comic book reviews in 100 words or less. Straight, concise, and to the point.***\\nTITLE: Superman #25\\nAUTHOR: Brian Michael Bendis\\nARTISTS: Ivan Reis, Julio Ferriera & Danny Miki (Inkers), Alex Sinclair (Colorist), Dave Sharpe (Letterer)\\nApparently in the post-New 52 continuity, or whatever continuity we\\'re in right now, Clark Kent and Lana Lang haven\\'t been in touch for awhile. Though apparently she was still Superwoman at one point…\\nFor a couple pages here, Ivan Reis gets to take on Clark\\'s Smallville days. That\\'s pretty cool. Less cool? He also draws the New 52 Superman costume. Though thankfully it looks less like armor.\\nI\\'ll be sad to see Bendis\\' run on the Superman books end in December. He did right by the Man of Steel.\\nTITLE: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #109\\nAUTHOR: Sophie Campbell, Kevin Eastman & Tom Waltz (Story Consultants)\\nARTISTS: Jodi Nishijima, Ronda Pattison (Colorist), Shawn Lee (Letterer)\\nIt continues to amaze me how this book is breaking the mold of what a TMNT story can be. What we\\'ve been getting lately is something more akin to a later issue of The Walking Dead. They\\'re trying to build a new society from the ground up.\\nMichaelangelo, for all intents and purposes, starts a Mutant Town podcast in this issue. That. Is. Genius.\\nTITLE: Something is Killing the Children #10\\nAUTHOR: James Tynion IV\\nARTISTS: Werther Dell\\'Edera, Miquel Muerto\\n\"While you worry about the rules, real people are getting hurt.\"\\nGood line.\\nThis is the first issue of Something is Killing the Children that I think went a little too far with the gore. We actually see a child get murdered in supernatural, yet still pretty brutal, fashion. I still dig the book at large, but that took me right out of the issue.\\nTITLE: Batman: The Adventures Continue #12\\nAUTHOR: Alan Burnett, Paul Dini\\nARTISTS: Ty Templeton, Monica Kubina (Colorist), Josh Reed (Letterer)\\new start getting into the nitty gritty of what the Joker does to Jason Todd in this issue. Harley Quinn is written as having a problem with it. That\\'s the first move Burnett and Dini have made that I really don\\'t buy.\\nI love that for the flashbacks where Jason is Robin, they switched Batman\\'s costume back to the old Batman: The Animated Series design. Great little continuity touch.\\nAll in all, I really like the DCAU spin they\\'ve put on A Death in the Family. And it looks like they\\'re about to stick the landing.\\nWeekly Comic 100s: TMNT Double-Feature, Wonder Woman #759, and More!\\nAUTHOR: Sophie Campbell (Story), Ronda Pattison (Script), Kevin Eastman & Tom Waltz (Story Consultants)\\nARTISTS: Nelson Daniel, Pattison (Colorist), Shawn Lee (Letterer). Variant cover by Eastman.\\nThe Turtles have an \"old days\" moment here where they head down to the sewers and fight a bunch of Mousers. It\\'s just a couple of cutesy lines. But it does serve as a reminder of just how different this series is from the standard TMNT status quo. Instead of four Turtles striking from the shadows, we\\'ve got five Turtles living openly in a town full of mutants.\\nAs they roam the sewers, the Turtles mix it up with what basically amounts to an undersea monster. It\\'s played like a horror movie. Kinda fun.\\nTITLE: TMNT Annual 2020\\nAUTHOR: Tom Waltz\\nARTISTS: Adam Gorham, John Rauch & Michael Garland (Colorists), Shawn Lee (Letterer). Variant cover by Kevin Eastman and Fahriza Kamputra (Colorist).\\nThis annual mainly serves as a check-in with our villains. Most notably Shredder, who we haven\\'t heard much from since issue #100. They color his costume purple and silver, like the old cartoon. I won\\'t complain about that…\\nAs the cover indicates, they\\'re doing a symbiosis story with Krang and Leatherhead. Yet another example of how this series continues to bring these characters into uncharted waters. Given how much has been done with the Ninja Turtles universe, it\\'s pretty amazing to see how much hasn\\'t been done.\\nTITLE: Wonder Woman #759\\nAUTHOR: Mariko Tamaki\\nARTISTS: Mikel Janin, Jordie Bellaire (Colorist), Pat Brosseau (Letterer). Cover by David Marquez.\\nSo we\\'ve got Mariko Tamaki, who wrote Supergirl: Being Super, and Mikel Janin, one of the stars of Tom King\\'s Batman run. On paper, this new team should be great.\\nTheir first issue is pretty ground level. Lots of flowery narration about what a hero is, what heroes do, etc. My only big problem is that Tamaki gives in to the temptation of putting Wondie in an everyday situation, shopping for furniture, and making it seem foreign to her. She\\'s been in \"man\\'s world\" for so long, yet she has no idea how to shop for furniture? Yeah, right.\\nTITLE: Darth Vader #3\\nAUTHOR: Greg Pak\\nARTISTS: Raffaele Ienco, Neeraj Menon (Colorist), Joe Caramagna (Letterer). Cover by Inhyuk Lee.\\nHow many times have we seen Darth Vader cross paths with characters from the prequels and then get all feelingsy? Enough that I rolled my eyes when Captain Typho showed up in this issue.\\nHowever, as someone who read Queen\\'s Shadow by E.K. Johnston, I appreciated the inclusion of Sabe and another character from that book. It\\'s a nice little tie-in that doesn\\'t take anything away from the story being told here.\\nTITLE: Batman: The Adventures Continue #9\\nAUTHORS: Alan Burnett, Paul Dini\\nARTISTS: Ty Templeton, Monica Cubina (Colorist), Joshua Reed (Letterer). Cover by Paolo Rivera & Joe Rivera.\\nIn this issue we finally get into Jason Todd\\'s origin story, his connection to Batman, etc. It\\'s not drastically altered from the comics. But it\\'s altered just enough to distinguish it. I liked what I saw.\\nFrankly, I hope they portray Jason Todd as having been with Batman for only a short time. In the DCAU I\\'d like to see him portrayed more as a tragically failed experiment than a lost son. Again, it would be different. But not so much that it\\'s unrecognizable. That\\'s the formula that seems to work best.\\nTITLE: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #52\\nAUTHOR: Ryan Parrot\\nARTISTS: Moises Hidalgo, Walter Baiamonte (Colorist), Katia Ranalli (Color Assistant), Ed Dukeshire (Letterer). Cover by Jamal Campbell.\\new\\'re still following Jason, Zack, and Trini, despite the events of this issue occurring after \"The Power Transfer.\" Not a bad thing, but not what I expected either. Especially since they\\'re getting their own book in a few months.\\nI\\'m not sure how I feel about the way Jamal Campbell posed Aisha on the cover. It\\'s like she\\'s showing off her butt or something…\\new introduce a civilian character in this issue who worries about the holding the Rangers accountable for their actions. Sort of a \"don\\'t trust the Power Rangers\" mindset. Very curious to see where that goes.\\nTITLE: Batman/Superman #9\\nAUTHOR: Joshua Williamson\\nARTISTS: Clayton Henry, Alejandro Sanchez (Colorist), John J. Hill (Letterer)\\nIn almost 20 years, I can count the number of Ultra-Humanite stories I\\'ve read on one hand. So this story is cool for me in that sense.\\nThis issue, and this team, have a really nice energy. Joshua Williamson is often hit-or-miss. But he, Clayton Henry, and Alejandro Sanchez make for a winning combination with these characters. Not a perfect combination per se, but a winning one.\\nTITLE: Suicide Squad #7\\nAUTHOR: Tom Taylor\\nARTISTS: Daniel Sampere, Juan Albarran (Inker), Adriano Lucas (Colorist), Wes Abbott (Letterer). Variant cover by Jeremy Roberts.\\nOur Tom Taylor original characters get a new team name in this issue: The Revolutionaries. Not bad. I don\\'t know how much of a life they\\'ll have out from under the Suicide Squad name. But still, not bad.\\nFor at least one issue, Taylor brings Floyd Lawton\\'s young daughter into the sandbox and gives her a a bow and arrow and a hero name: Liveshot. She almost reminds me of a kid version of the Kate Bishop Hawkeye. Interesting…\\nTITLE: Billionaire Island #2\\nAUTHOR: Mark Russell\\nARTISTS: Steve Pugh, Chris Chuckry (Colorist), Rob Steen (Letterer)\\nIt seems that in addition to the absurdly rich, Billionaire Island is home certain rich, famous, and disgraced. We get an actual Kevin Spacey cameo in this issue. Yes, I wretched. But it\\'s also a funny little moment.\\new haven\\'t gotten into the bloodshed yet. But the book does crank up the action a little bit with this issue. Something tells me it\\'s going to be worth the wait.\\nWeekly Comic 100s: Batman, Dead Body Road, TMNT, and More!\\nLast week I said I missed Star Wars and TMNT comics. This week we got the return of Bounty Hunters, and a double-dose of TMNT. Where are you gonna find a more fair friggin\\' deal than that?\\nThis week\\'s new releases are pretty light. So I\\'m holding a few back from last week\\'s pull list. That Texas Blood is one of them. We might also see Marvels Snapshot: Captain America and/or Harley Quin: Black + White + Red.\\nTITLE: Batman #93\\nARTISTS: Guillem March, Javier Fernandez, Tomeu Morey & David Baron (Colorists), Clayton Cowles (Letterer). Cover by Tony Daniel.\\nThe Designer\\'s role in this story more or less wraps up in this issue. That\\'s a little sad, as I liked that character concept. Even if the costume was a little bit much.\\nPunchline, the Joker\\'s new answer to Harley Quinn, gets put over pretty strong here. They obviously want her to be a big deal. She\\'s got an interesting worldview, and it\\'s not as crazy as you might think. Her costume is definitely cosplay-friendly. Not quite as much as Harley, but expect to see her around the convention scene.\\nTITLE: Dead Body Road: Bad Blood #1\\nAUTHOR: Justin Jordan\\nARTISTS: Benjamin Tiesma, Mat Lopes (Colorist), Pat Brosseau (Letterer). Cover by Matteo Scalera & Morena Dinisio.\\nThis issue has a strong hook. For yours truly, most of that has to do with our heroine, Bree Hale. We establish her as a small town girl-next-door type. But obviously she has a history that allows her to kick all kinds of ass and escape perilous situations. She\\'s particularly strong in the climactic sequence as she fights off a sadistic interrogator.\\nMy understanding is this isn\\'t connected with the previous Dead Body Road mini at all, and that it\\'s an anthology book like Criminal. So you should be okay coming in cold.\\nAUTHORS: Sophie Campbell (Script), Kevin Eastman & Tom Waltz (Story Consultants)\\nARTISTS: Campbell, Ronda Pattison (Colorist), Shawn Lee (Letterer).\\nThere\\'s a big moment between Raph and Alopex in this issue that leads me to believe we\\'re headed toward fairly uncharted waters: Romantic interests for the Turtles.\\nAnd no, don\\'t talk about Mitsu in TMNT III. Please.\\nI\\'m game for really putting the Teenage in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Especially now that they\\'re doing this Mutant Town story. Between the Raph/Alopex scene and the concert setting, this issue really does that well. They\\'ve got a chance to break some new ground here. Let\\'s hope they take it.\\nTITLE:TMNT: Jennika #3\\nAUTHOR: Braham Revel, Ronda Pattison\\nARTISTS: Revel, Jodi Nishijima, Pattison (Colorist), Shawn Lee (Letters).\\nI can\\'t get over how much Braham Revel\\'s style reminds me of the 2012 Nickelodeon show.\\nIt\\'s amazing to think how virtually everything The Next Mutation did wrong with Venus di Milo, IDW has done right with Jennika. Although based on how the IDWverse has been put together, we might actually see Venus in the comics at some point.\\nBebop and Rocksteady show up here. Why does Rocksteady carry an average-sized sledgehammer? It feels like it should be bigger. Mutant-sized. That, or a giant blaster like on the old cartoon.\\nAUTHOR: Ryan Parrott\\nARTISTS: Daniele Di Nicuolo, Walter Baiamonte (Colorist), Katia Ranalli (Color Assistant), Ed Dukeshire (Letterer). Cover by Jamal Campbell.\\nRyan Parrott does Rocky, Adam, and Aisha a lot of justice in these books. That\\'s one of those things that\\'s expected, but still really nice when you actually see it. Rocky is also sans mullet, which I appreciate.\\n\"Necessary Evil\" might have gone a little long. But it was still a story very much worth telling. Well executed too, in terms of both the writing and the visuals.\\nDefinitely a worthy issue #50. And if the cliffhanger at the end is any indication, PR fans are going to want to come back for issue #51.\\nARTISTS: Bruno Redondo, Adriano Lucas (Colorist), Wes Abbott (Letterer). Cover by Redondo & Marcelo Maiolo.\\nThe humor in this issue is on-point. Especially with Batman doing a guest shot. That\\'s a high compliment coming from me, as I don\\'t usually get into Harley-Quinn-style comedy.\\new\\'re teased with a separation of Harley and Deadshot from all the various new characters in the group. That would be interesting, though I expect ultimately a bad move for sales. I\\'d stick around, though. Again, a pretty high compliment from yours truly.\\nTITLE: Star Wars: Bounty Hunters #3\\nAUTHOR: Ethan Sacks\\nARTISTS: Paolo Villanelli, Arif Prianto (Colorist), Travis Lanham (Letterer). Cover by Lee Bermejo.\\nBoba Fett is teased for this issue, but doesn\\'t show. I\\'m curious as to how much of him we\\'ll need to see to keep this series afloat as the months go by. That\\'s not to say characters like Bossk and Valance aren\\'t appealing. But Boba\\'s drawing power is obvious at this point. You could easily make the argument for doing a Boba Fett series, much like the Darth Vader one.\\nI grow a little weary of the story they\\'re telling about all these hunters having a common target. The target in question simply isn\\'t that interesting. Not yet, at least.\\nTMNT: The Movie at 30: Fan Film Inspiration\\nIn my experience, fan films are very hit or miss. And as far as Ninja Turtle fan films go, it\\'s almost always a miss. The reason is very simple: A fan film simply doesn\\'t have the budget to create Turtle costumes that suspend disbelief. It\\'s primarily a lip sync issue. Hell, in a lot of them the mouths don\\'t move at all.\\nBut two TMNT fan films have'"

I could never understand why Uncle Ray used the dog analogy to describe his bird… I can also recall being in a chemistry lesson and using the same bench as a little kid called George. George spent just about the whole 45 minute lesson singing this wretched song over and over without pause. I was just about at the end of my tether and reaching for a metal tri-pod in order to silence him (we comprehensive school herberts used to do these things) when I was beaten to the punch, quite literally, by an enormous lad called Errol, whose solitary blow ensured that George \"got down\" indeed.

As far as I can tell he\\'s basically a British Nilsson, yes? Somewhat more limited range, but same multitracked Beatlesey quality, bathrobe, doe eyes? I like these songs pretty good, and \"Get Down\" seems to me the best of the bunch so far. Fantastic hook! There\\'s a Chicory Tipness to the backing track, which I\\'m always a sucker for, and the turnaround on \"…but I still want you around!\" is as catchy a thing you could ever ask for.\\nMinuses for the generally miscellaneous and non-specific quality of the lyrics – does the cat on the hot tin roof need to be in there? The whole bit about drinking some wine time goes nowhere, not even as an analogy for how he feels now or anything like that. He might as well mention that he once owned a Buick. This song gets better the less closely it\\'s listened to, but its emptiness is much better-hidden than, say \"Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep\"\\'s and it\\'s a better song for it.\\nIt may be helpful to know that the main influence behind Gilbert\\'s lyric writing was, and probably still is, Spike Milligan; see \"Ooh Wakka Doo Wakka Day\" (or maybe not) for a fuller demonstration of this.\\nI think it\\'s pretty straightforward though; given that he is frustrated and perhaps also a little intimidated by his dog, the \"cat\" is a good and basic analogy of his current emotional position, but the \"time/wine\" meme only really works if one extends the canine object to a rather unseemly metaphor, i.e. once he was footloose and fancy free but now he\\'s tied down by this, um, dog, and perhaps we\\'d better not go down that dimly lit road…\\nThe British Nilsson isn\\'t a bad comparison point, though Randy Newman is possibly a better fit (so that \"Get Down\" becomes his \"Short People\"), though I should point out that neither of these distinguished gentlemen began their career dressed in schoolboy cap and short trousers as Gilbert did up until \"Alone Again\"…the idea being that he thought he\\'d get places if he looked the direct and polar opposite of how everybody else looked in \\'69/70…\\nDoctor Casino † on 21 Sep 2007 #\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xHyKyoEh5Q – Pan\\'s People dancers with a bunch of live dogs performing to \"Get Down.\" Thought some readers here might appreciate it…\\nlinda † on 8 Oct 2007 #\\ncan you tell me what gilber osulivan is doing now and is he going to do any more concerts\\njeff w † on 8 Oct 2007 #\\nCurrent UK tour details can be found here:\\nhttp://www.gilbertosullivan.net/\\nrichard thompson on 24 May 2008 #\\nThe music of Gilbert O\\'Sullivan was on in place of TOTP during his second week at number one, he sang this song first, the Pans People dog dance was on xmas day, does he really sing I don\\'t give a damn, as that word is used in the next number one.\\ngilbert get down † on 27 May 2008 #\\n[…] hits album in the M&ampVE 50p basement in the late 90s, and playing get down again and again.http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/2007/07/gilbert-osullivan-get-down/The man who will wake the monster – This is London&quotThe cathedral of the electrons&quot is how HJ […]\\nStevie † on 22 Mar 2011 #\\nTotal Bang-A-Gong rip, but great for the same reasons.\\nMark G † on 22 Mar 2011 #\\n(and linda didn\\'t even say thanks, even though JeffW answered almost immediately: #56 and #57)\\nwichita lineman † on 22 Mar 2011 #\\nShe was asking about gilber osulivan, though.\\nErithian † on 26 Aug 2011 #\\nJust to alert Populistas to a mini-Gilbert O\\'Sullivan theme night on BBC4 this evening, a profile followed by a concert performance alongside, er, Chris de Burgh.\\nMark G † on 26 Aug 2011 #\\nLady in red, get down.\\nActually, that sort-of improves it!\\nAndyPandy on 26 Aug 2011 #\\n44: I thought everyone knew about how synonymous Pink Floyd are with the Orb all the way from Alex Paterson making \\'Echoes\\' off \\'Meddle\\' such a big track in the original chillout room at Spectrum/Land of Oz in 1988 to last years collaboration album between The Orb and Dave Gilmour \\'Metallic Spheres\\' (Incidentally a wicked album if you give it time).\\nAfter all once chilling out as we know it now had arrived what more did you need than a few Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream and Orb albums to keep you nicely relaxed till the pubs opened.\\nPatrick Mexico on 2 Dec 2013 #\\nI genuinely don\\'t think I\\'ve heard a single track on that first Guilty Pleasures compilation.\\n(For reference, I was born in 1985 and my earliest TOTP memory was Ace of Base – All That She Wants in summer 1993.)\\nMy parents were both in the thick of their teens by \"now\", but whether it was Motown or Van Morrison (for now, disregard that one about the pair of brown eyes that isn\\'t by the Pogues), both tended to appreciate classic songwriting and sincerity above kitsch appeal or gimmickry.. more out of disinterest in the GP market than real \"guilt.\"\\nlonepilgrim on 9 Jun 2019 #\\nAround this time a friend of my parents owned G.O\\'S previous album (featuring Clair) and I found that fairly pleasant as background music. Apart from his earliest hits his music seems to settle for familiar sentiment rather than anything more compelling. He has more in common with McCartney in that respect although both seem to have done their best work when contemplating loss. As for this, not a guilty pleasure, more a guilt free meh.\\nLee Saunders on 13 Jun 2019 #\\n^I love that second album (Back to Front) and early-mid 70s Gilbert in general, and mention of the record as background music (and by Christgau as\\'more-or-less easy listening\\') just reminds me how I\\'d love for Gilbert to undergo a Scott Walker style\\'so much there behind the MORE facade\\' style reappraisal. Peter Skellern, too, whose own You\\'re a Lady is as wonderful as Alone Again (Naturally), and whose sparse music hall flop Our Jackie\\'s Getting Married is like a Northern equivalent to some of the character-driven homeliness on Himself, which I\\'d single out as Gilbert\\'s best album (the multifarious Houidini Said being for me his finest song and one of the era\\'s finest baroque pop records). But then the more vaudevillian moments from these early albums, like January Git, turn up for me on things like the Divine Comedy\\'s A Woman of the World, suggesting his influence has been quietly assimilated.\\nGet Down is from the third album, I\\'m a Writer, Not a Fighter, which after two albums that flickered between oom-pah rhythms and dense string arrangements was a little less variety show and more of a conscious nod to the times, something he avoided consciously with Back to Front. I suspect the fact he now toured may have played a part in that, but it was the beginning of the end as far as his commercial success was concerned. Half the album is classic Gilbert and half of it is Stevie Wonder funk that, not comparing with, say, The Crunge for oddness, is still all sprightly and right, particularly the inventive Not in a Million Years. Also, the record\\'s half-hour playing time means it doesn\\'t outstay its welcome and stays as vivacious as its strikingly coloured sleeve, even if, going back to Skellern, its fair to say that Gilbert\\'s new interest in black pop doesn\\'t reach the heights of Hold On to Love.\\n(Register to guarantee your comments don\\'t get marked as spam.)\\nIf this was number 1 when you were born paste [stork-boy] or [stork-girl] into the start of your comment :)\\nMail Required (Your email address will not be published)\\nI\\'m writing about every UK number one single, in order.

And the Hollywood side seems a little ticked off that Quesada has been heard to be claiming credit for much of the \"Spider-Man\" success. And as a result of all this, Joe Quesada may be dropped. And if nothing else, Jemas and Quesada have been told to lay off DC Comics, CrossGen and the like. Newsarama reported that in the Marvel panel, Quesada denied these rumours.\\nBut let\\'s look a little deeper. Only a little mind. There have been versions of this story before now, but there are a few interesting points here.\\nFirstly, Marvel higher ups have previously been very happy with the higher press profile Marvel has been having - and it\\'s not like the aggressive anti-competitor spiel is a new thing.\\nSecondly, doing the maths, it seems that Joe Quesada\\'s two-year contract at Marvel will be up in September. Will Marvel use this as a way to jettison him?\\nThirdly, has the higher public profile rumoured to have annoyed the Marvel suits, also provided him with some protection. One might speculate that if Joe was to walk the plank, would the share price, jittery as it is right now, plummet?\\nFourthly, there\\'s that pesky revenue stream that he seems to have brought back to Marvel. Marvel Knights alone profits million of dollars a year.\\nFifthly, how much would Joe Quesada be worth in the open market? I\\'ve already heard rumours that he could find himself in on the west coast in Hollywood, representing Marvel, or working for a studio. And the other far more head-warping rumour places him just down the road, taking over Paul Levitz\\' position at DC Comics.\\nMaybe I should just put him on eBay to find out…\\nULTIMATISING THE MARVEL UNIVERSE\\nWhen asked about last week\\'s LITG story, that Marvel plan to Ultimatise all their line in the near future, Mark Millar posted on Millarworld \"As for Marvel going Ultimate, I\\'m afraid you may THINK that, dear boy, but I couldn\\'t possibly COMMENT. Let\\'s just say the \\'Ultimate\\' line was very far-sighted when it was created. More from me on this in an upcoming interview.\"\\nThe first comment is a reference to the TV and book series, House Of Cards, featuring a character who would not speak on the record - but would always confirm a story with that phrase.\\nOne of the reasons being given for the Ultimatisation of the Marvel Universe is sales. Now, while \"New X-Men\" and \"Amazing Spider-Man\" outsell their \"Ultimate\" counterparts in the traditional direct market, there\\'s another direct market that has slowly started to emerge. The expansive chain store Wal-Mart has a deal with Marvel comics to order their \"Ultimate\" titles, non-returnable to the tune of a million a month between them. And while that weights towards \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" and \"Ultimate X-Men,\" that still adds hundreds and thousand of guaranteed sales. And they seem to stock them by the action figures and toys rather than by the books and magazines - guaranteed to get them in front of kids.\\nNow, it\\'s clear that Wal-Mart must have got a hell of a deal in order to make such a commitment, allegedly up into 2004. And anecdotal reports indicate that sell-through isn\\'t great. But if both Marvel and Wal-Mart are making a profit, and pushing a certain product line to \"civilian\" customers, everybody wins. But they only want the \"Ultimate\" line, so...\\nGUTTERATI GATOZHIAN REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR\\nOne of our first gutterati, known only as Gatozhian, tells me \"The \"Ultimatisation\" of the Marvel line is a done deal from what I hear, but not till late 2003. Something about fulfilling agreements. And New X-Men #150 is the end of it all.\"\\nHe reports that the unmasking trend at Marvel may well continue, and to keep a close eye on the upcoming \"Spider-Man 50.\" He also mentions that Ron Zimmerman and Darick Robertson are getting their own Spider-related book...\\nThanks Gatozhian. Your traffic light is on red for now- but if those stories start to come true, that will change very quickly.\\nDo you want to join the gutterati? Email me on twisting@hotmail.com\\nTIBET PART TWO\\nLast week, Lying in the Gutters printed the rumour that certain DC books have had storylines featuring or mentioning Tibet curtailed or amended so as not to conflict with AOL Time Warner\\'s expansion into China.\\nOn the DC Universe panel at WizardWorld, writer Geoff Johns indicated his intention to write a Tibet story, probably in Flash. One to watch, folks.\\nDAREDEVIL/BULLSEYE FROM FABRY AND SMITH?\\nI understand that the new top secret Glenn Fabry project for Marvel mentioned in a previous column is also the new top secret Kevin Smith project for Marvel.\\nDaredevil/Bullseye. One to anticipate.\\nFRAY DELAYED - AND NOT BY THE HOLLYWOOD WRITER\\nI understand that Dark Horse is having real problems getting Joss Whedon\\'s future slayer comic, \"Fray,\" finished. But now it\\'s not as many suspect, the writer\\'s schedule that\\'s at fault, it\\'s the artist. Seems that when Karl Moline went off to CrossGen he thought he\\'d be able to finish it before he started \"Route 666.\" He didn\\'t. I understand that issue 7 is only half-completed so far\\nPREVIEWS REVEALS FUTURE PROJECTS\\nPreviews doesn\\'t seem to be the hard-and-fast online document it once was. Diamond seem to have been… well, changing a few bits and pieces soon after initial uploading. And if you catch it in time, you might see some future projects that weren\\'t meant to have been listed that month. Not only was \"Captain America: The Truth\" first solicited for August, it was done so without mentioning the aspects that have caused so much discourse of late. But there\\'s also this little nugget from this month\\'s files - well it was there very recently, anyway.\\nEDEN\\'S TRAIL #1 (OF 6)\\nCover by Steve Uy\\nSteve Uy (w & a)\\nA brand-new adventure of sci-fi action in the widescreen Marvel Scope format!

Don\\'t worry.\\nBryan Hitch took time out to talk about his schedule on the book - how it slipped, and how he\\'s putting it right.\\n\"Mark and I should have started issue one in June of last year, but due to Mark\\'s extended bout with illness and thankfully groundless cancer scare we didn\\'t put pen to paper until the second week of September, which although giving me all the time I needed to watch Wimbledon and do the design work did set us behind since our launch date was already set for Jan.\"\\n\"This meant we couldn\\'t do the double sized first issue as planned, but it also yielded the unexpected benefit of giving us the chance to re-evaluate what we wanted to do and the whole concept became what we now know. It may interest readers to know that what was originally intended to be in that first double sized issue expanded to fill these first five issues when the characters took on unexpected extra life with more of their stories to tell. Sometimes you just have to let things breathe.\"\\n\"Anyway, The first issue of anything always takes me longer to do, say six weeks instead of four, but in this case it was so period specific and reference heavy that time just got eaten up researching the costumes, uniforms, armaments, settings, aircraft and all the other necessary details. Worth it in the long run possibly, but very time consuming.\"\\n\"Issues two, three and four all took four weeks or so, but the damage was already done and adding to the problem was the fact that over the course of those first five issues we wrote and drew about seventeen extra pages on top of the required 21 per issue and it comes as no surprise that we slipped behind. We could all see it happening, but keeping our fingers crossed wasn\\'t really doing the job!\\n\"Everyone has been trying to find ways of avoiding fill in issues as, after all, nobody wants to have somebody else write a chapter of their novel, and Marvel have been both generous and supportive in all their efforts to give Mark and I (mostly me) whatever help they can.\"\\n\"So we found ourselves with about a week to draw issue five, which being the big budget spectacle we were waiting for, was just not remotely possible without channelling the spirit of Jack Kirby. Illness of my own and some other personal nonsense added to the already existing problems by pushing the time taken on the issue to seven weeks and, presto, you have the current situation.\"\\n\"Issue six has indeed taken three weeks to pencil and will be at the printers next week. So the ongoing process of catching up continues. Issues will be out monthly from now, and if we manage to get where we want to be by the end of the year, the may be an extra surprise or two. Keeping shtum, lest you run rumours. The one about Mark Millar working in nothing but a Powerpuff Girls kitchen apron are true, however.\"\\nMy eyes, Bryan, my eyes!\\nCALL AND BLACK CAT ON DOTCOMICS, ULTIMATE SPIDEY OFF\\nI understand that Marvel will be putting \"The Call: Precinct\" onto its Dot.Comics listings, as well as the new \"Black Cat\" series. But this might be at the cost of dropping dotComics leader, \"Ultimate Spider-Man.\"\\nDREAMWAVE LOSE ROBOTECH, GAIN ZELDA\\nWith reports that Wildstorm are pursuing \"Robotech\" comics, it\\'s interesting that, like with \"Thundercats,\" Dreamwave originally had the \"Robotech\" licence. Planning to announce a \"Robotech\" prequel, \"Genesis,\" at San Diego, they found those negotiations with owners Harmony Gold stalled. Jay Faerber was originally meant to be the writer - and had written both the Robotech bible and the first story arc synopsis.\\nHowever, I\\'ve also heard that Dreamwave have secured the \"Legend of Zelda\" license. Oooh!\\nHOWARD CHAYKIN DRAWS ALAN MOORE\\nHoward Chaykin is back at the boards. Look for him to be drawing a \"Tom Strong\" story for Alan Moore shortly. Moore had wanted Chaykin to draw a story for him for quite a while but missed Chaykin\\'s window last time on \"Tom Strong.\" Not this time- eventually Moore always gets his man.\\nJOHNNY NEMO RETURNS\\nHow about a collection of Milligan and Ewins\\' classic \"Johnny Nemo\" series including the first all-new Nemo story in almost a decade, courtesy of Cyberosia this autumn?\\nUnless of course DC steal that one under Cyberosia\\'s noses like they did Skreemer...\\nDC UNIVERSE TITLES SHIP WITHOUT CODE\\nIt appears that a number of DC\\'s August 2002\\'s books are missing the Comics Code Seal. And no, not the Vertigos, but the DC Universe line. Titles so far include \"Action Comics #792,\" \"Birds of Prey #44,\" \"JSA #37,\" \"Wonder Woman #182\"... say, has Mike Carlin been rolling his eyes at the Comic Code Authority? IS DC following in Marvel\\'s lead?\\nOr is it just a screw-up?\\nX-MEN EVOLUTION - ORDER HIGH!\\nRetailers - having difficulty beating Marvel\\'s full line incentives for June orders? Not placed your order yet? Not to worry, just add a few more copies of \"X-Men Evolution\" 10 until you qualify. After all, it\\'s been cancelled…\\nTHUNDERBOLTS TO BE REVAMPED - THE STORY CONTINUES\\nAny more on \"Thunderbolts\" being revamped and restarted, written by John Arcudi after issue 75? From the AOL Kurt Busiek folder, when user FCFlink14 said \"BTW, i believe thunderbolts is the 4th longest lasting non-rebooted series currently coming out from marvel (behind Wolverine, New X-Men and Uncanny X-Men). Who\\'da thunk it?\", Kurt replied \"Wait six months...\"\\nKYLE BAKER\\'S PLANS\\nMore from Kyle Baker. As well as the \"Plastic Man\" graphic novel, \"Captain America: The Truth,\" his Looney Tunes animation work for Warner Bros, \"Cowboy Wally 2\" and a \"Superman\" novel, DC are also republishing the first \"Cowboy Wally Show.\" Considered a masterpiece of a graphic novel, it\\'s already been through Doubleday and Marlowe, and even a spinoff appearance in Marvel\\'s Epic Lite. This time it looks like it\\'ll get the production quality it\\'s always deserved.\\nThis is the age of Kyle Baker.\\nHULK, LIVE-ACTION TV SERIES?\\nI understand that Studios USA is supposedly developing a new live-action Hulk TV series, to play off the upcoming movie version - but they\\'re keeping it a secret.\\nThere have been rumours about a new cartoon, but these seem to be decoys, planted to keep fans off the scent, in case it doesn\\'t pan out. Like Thor.\\nStill, if you\\'re a pro-wrestler-turned-actor, maybe you should give them a call...\\nKEVIN SMITH CHANGES STRACZYNSKI\\'S PLANS\\nJoe Michael Straczynski writes on the Usenet newsgroup rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated.\\n\"I have a three-pronged deal: stories with established characters in the Marvel Universe, reviving dormant characters in the MU as well as creating new characters there, and creating wholly new characters in a non-MU situation allowing me to do pretty much anything I want.\"\\n\"Well, that\\'s not absolutely accurate...when Kevin Smith came on board, he asked to be given dibs on bringing MJ and Peter together again, if and when that decision should be made. So in terms of that aspect, all I can do is kind of play around the edges a bit, the ball is well and truly in Kevin\\'s court, he\\'s the only one who can resolve and bring them together if that is the way Marvel wants to go.\"\\n\"I was gonna bring \\'em together again shortly, because it was my intent to get them apart only for a while, but at this point it\\'ll be an if/when situation between Marvel and Kevin.\"\\nStraczynski clarified this further in email, saying \"What a lot of people seem not to understand, or have chosen to understand, is that I said, from the git-go, that I only wanted to clear the decks of all the supporting characters *for a while* so that I could focus solely on who Peter was, with the goal of gradually working them all back in again once I\\'d tidied up the place a bit. Which is why all these \"JMS hates MJ and wants her gone forever\" posts always puzzled me, since I\\'d never said that, and had, in fact, in my public posts (searchable on any of a number of databases) said exactly what I said above, that it was meant to be a temporary situation.\"\\nSo is this long-awaited get-together happening in \"Black Cat?\" Or Kevin Smith\\'s other Spider-Man plans?\\nSCHEDULE AND COVERS FOR AMAZING SPIDER-MAN\\nFrank Cho is drawing three covers for \"Amazing Spider-Man,\" the first due out in October.

But what does it mean? Could it be a reference to the manuscript \"The City Of The Sun\" by Italian writer Tommaso Campanella, written in 1602. The story tells of a utopian city built and lived in by seemingly perfect beings. One might presume 1602 will tell a similar tale. But with The Thing, Daredevil and Mr Fantastic... okay, maybe not. But 1602 is a fundraiser for the legal battle over Marvelman/Miracleman - which, during Gaiman\\'s run portrayed a utopian world built by wondrous beings… Read the manuscript in question here.\\n\"Black Panther\" - Relaunched but not renumbered after issue 50 and the end of the Death Of Black Panther comic, when Dan Fraga becomes \"Black Panther\" artist.

Getting better. The battles are, without a doubt, rather tough, and the story\\'s gotten intriguing as I\\'ve left the first area.

Just super sharp dialogue and an endearing level of charm.\\nRayman Legends – Super quick challenge levels this week. Min and I need to unlock Awesomeness lvl 2.\\nSpelunky – Played the XBLA version one last time before I signed off forever thanks to the release of the PC version. Didn\\'t get past the jungle due to some dumb play. It\\'s really easy to fall out of practice with Spelunky.\\nAnimal Crossing: New Leaf – I really thought I\\'d be able to bring fruit home with me from the dream suite. Kind of lame that you can\\'t.\\nThe Last of Us – They try and pretend all the time that you can pick how you want to approach encounters.

You don\\'t need to knock on wood]. Should that even be an achievement?\\n2012 seems to be a shift in the status quo. Perhaps it\\'s because the new console generation hasn\\'t yet kicked off, but I feel like fewer and fewer AAA, big budget titles have been grabbing my attention lately. Of the 56 games on this list I feel like very few (about 12) were big, huge landmark games. Maybe that\\'s not all that different, but it feels different…\\nAlso, like last year I do count games on this list that did not launch in 2012, but that I played, started, or beat in 2012.\\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective – The weirdest thing about my time with this game was that I chose to play it in Spanish. It was fine practice and, off the top of my head, it taught me two Spanish words I had no use for before playing it (sotano and cachorro, meaning basement and puppy/cub/kitten, respectively), but it also featured very funny writing by Phoenix Wright\\'s creator and a bizarrely complicated story for such a slight-looking game. In fact, 2012 was kind of a year of interactive fiction, as you\\'ll see, so it\\'s appropriate to see GT get top billing. It\\'s also worth mentioning that the animation in this game is spectacular.\\nRayman: Origins – Also known as the game where Min and I attained Super Saiyan level for the first time. No lie, guys, the treasure chest levels and the final Level of the Dead or whatever it was called was a zen-like achievement for the pair of us. If New Super Mario Bros. isn\\'t your bag, but you think you might still love platformers then you absolutely need to try this game out.\\nChrono Trigger DS – Yeah, I played this in the 90s. Yep, it was my first RPG. The DS port added some marginal sections, including an epilogue that sets up for Chrono Cross in the most depressing way possible, but it also came with a new translation that I thought was interesting and brought some freshness to an otherwise \"solved\" game for me.\\nEarthbound – I wish I\\'d spent more time trying to replay Earthbound, but I just didn\\'t. Heck, I don\\'t think I got too far past meeting Buzz Buzz…Still love this game.\\nCave Story + – How I long for dynamic difficulty level changing! Cave Story + is a fantastic Metroidvania-style pixel shooter, but my hubris determined I would play on the hardest difficulty, which means I\\'m stuck on Monster X until I can get my skills down pat.\\nFinal Fantasy XIII-2 – Remember how everyone\\'s favorite character in FF XIII was Lightning\\'s sister and some guy no one ever saw in FF XIII? Wait…those weren\\'t your favorite characters? You don\\'t want to play another 40 hours as those chuckleheads and watch Snow, Hope, and Sazh from afar while playing a nearly incomprehensible story? Too bad!\\nSaints Row: The Third – I feel bad for you if you\\'ve never played Saints Row: The Third. I felt bad for myself for not having played it sooner than I did. For maximum awesomeness be sure to give your boss the Latina voice. It\\'s priceless. Seriously though, this game is the best open world game I have ever played. Period. It\\'s absurd, ridiculous, and nonsensical, but it\\'s winking every step of the way and I\\'m right there with it.\\nRhythm Heaven Fever – When I first started writing this list I forgot that this little gem came out in 2012. Can you believe it?! Min, I know you don\\'t understand the appeal here, but this is honestly among my favorite game of this year. Did I spend $80 importing the soundtrack from Japan? You betcha. Goddammit this game is so good. It\\'s a must play for anyone with a Wii (or a Wii U). Seriously, go buy it. It\\'s incredible.\\nDevil Survivor 2 – Man, the Megrez fight is so stupid and I\\'m not properly equipped, demon-wise, to tackle it, which is why I never beat this game. It\\'s better than DS1, mechanically, but I just need to sit down and grind my way out of this and I really don\\'t want to have to do that…Bonus points for also pretty much being Evangelion\\nMass Effect 3 – Hoo boy…What a shitshow this game\\'s release was…I wish I\\'d beaten it faster than I had because by the time I reached the ending, well, the internet had practically exploded with criticism. I spent more time wading in comments sections and forums defending the artistic integrity of a game that I honestly didn\\'t find that impressive compared to the rest of the year\\'s releases, but it just rubbed me the wrong way to see the fanboys demand changes from Bioware. I mean, whine all you want, but so long as Bioware doesn\\'t cave– What\\'s that? You say they did cave? They did change the ending as a response to fan whining? My respect for Bioware and this game flew out the window the second that happened. As far as I\\'m concerned, I played the real Mass Effect 3, but I never got the chance to enjoy it. Now that the doctors are gone from Bioware and the company is soliciting advice on what direction to take Dragon Age III, I find myself thinking, \"Man, what happened to Bioware?\" It\\'s a real shame because Mass Effect 3 was actually quite good.\\nShadow Complex – Way late to the party on this one, but I was feeling that Metroidvania itch and, well, this game kind of scratches it. I hate the third dimension they added to the gun because it makes aiming a pain. Other than that it\\'s fine. Serviceable, really, but it also gets credit for being the first \"autolog\" type game that I can think of.\\nJamestown – I don\\'t play a lot of vertical/horizontal shooters. Jamestown just happened to be out in a lull and I owned it from a Humble Bundle. It\\'s enjoyable enough and I dig playing it with multiple people, but it\\'s not going to set the world on fire. Playing the story in \"funny\" mode is fun too because the alternative is almost obnoxiously self-serious.\\nSuperbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP – Cool music and a cool aesthetic, but it controls weird on the PC. I wish I had an iPad for stuff like this and that I put more time into this game.\\nThe Walking Dead – I thought about separating this out into episodes across the series, but it seems cleaner to talk about this game in one fell swoop even though I started it in April and finished it in November. I know I said that Rhythm Heaven Fever was the best game of this year, but The Walking Dead is actually the best thing to have come out this year. I\\'ll grant you that it\\'s more interactive fiction than game, but even that\\'s not that important, really. I mean, would putting more puzzles in this adventure game make it any better? Of course not! The Walking Dead is the success it is because it\\'s a character-driven story of the likes we haven\\'t seen before. Lee Everett may not be making the galaxy-defining choices that Commander Shepard makes on a daily basis, but the stakes always seem higher as he does his best to shepherd young Clementine through a world that only gets worse and worse for everyone. That last scene in the jewelry store as Lee coaches Clem to safety…It touched me (and I\\'m sure most anyone who played it) in a way that nothing else this year could. I\\'m not being hyperbolic when I say that everyone should play this game. It\\'s brilliant.\\nFez – Speaking of brilliant, Fez has that in spades. We\\'re talking about a game where every detail feels deliberate and mysterious. That\\'s not an exaggeration either. With maybe one exception, there\\'s not a single puzzle in Fez that you couldn\\'t necessarily figure out in some way from clues in the world. They might be obscure, difficult to interpret clues, but they\\'re there. Add in a soundtrack that is hauntingly beautiful and a rotating mechanic that is as fun as anything else you\\'ve ever done and you\\'ve got the most interesting experience of 2012. I can still pull up intense memories of the empty solitude of some of the screens and the fitting music that made me feel isolated, alone, a little scared, and a little excited to discover a cube or an anticube. Fez was awesome, guys.\\nDiablo 3 – I\\'ve had this talk with Min so many times, but maybe I didn\\'t understand what Diablo was before I played D3. I\\'d only ever played D2 with my brother or a few friends. It was a small-scale endeavor and Torchlight, its closest analogue for me, was a single-player affair. There was no Auction House there to circumvent loot drops or other players to set up trades with on forums. There was the purity of the RNG and the thrill of the hunt. Diablo 3 awakened that feeling inside me that activates when I feel like I\\'ve been cheated. It was like I took the red pill and I saw the Matrix of the game for the first time when I realized what I\\'d have to do to beat the game on Inferno. I\\'ve never felt like a game\\'s systems were so transparently evil before (I don\\'t play Facebook games) and Diablo 3 soured me on Blizzard as a developer. Maybe next year you\\'ll see an entry about Heart of the Swarm, but as of right now, thanks to Diablo 3, I plan on never spending another cent on a Blizzard game (unless a new Warcraft RTS comes out. I actually like those).\\nTropico 4 – Min likes to tease me about being an evil dictator when I play this game, but it\\'s much more complicated for me. When I play Tropico I don\\'t exercise my ability to rig elections or execute citizens at will. I do my best to be a benevolent leader and resist the control/interference of the US or USSR. I do my best to make the tropical paradise that I feel my people have been denied. It\\'s a deeply (and weirdly) personal experience for me. Plus the music is pretty sweet.\\nThe Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the Lamb – Yeah, yeah, expansion pack for a game that I played relentlessly last year. I don\\'t care, guys, it was almost a new game with how much it added. If you read my blog and you tried/enjoyed FTL, you really should check this out.\\nNo More Heroes: Paradise – I think I\\'m at assassin #7 or #6? It\\'s got its purposefully tedious parts in it and it\\'s so stylized that it\\'s hilarious, but it lost some steam with me and I never finished it. Whoops.\\nSpelunky – Forget what that other guy said about the best game of this year because Spelunky is awesome. It\\'s so sharp in the way that it plays. Die and it\\'s almost 100% your fault. Brutally difficult, endearingly fun and funny, and tightly controlled. I only wish I had more friends to play local multiplayer with.\\nPenny Arcade 2 – Not as funny as PA1 and not as fun as PA3\\nPenny Arcade 3 – PA goes 16-bit RPG. The combat is frighteningly difficult, but the game is tons of fun because of it. These new classes are super neat. It\\'s like they figured out all the boundaries to RPG combat and sharpened them to a knife\\'s edge. Really interesting, but easy to bone yourself with bad class selection.\\nSins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – Each game takes forever, but playing a few matches with Min was tons of fun.\\nGreed Corp – Did not like. Sorry, Eric.\\nPuzzle Agent – Tried this before I went down the Professor Layton rabbit\\'s hole. Surprisingly funny and surprisingly well-written. I\\'m fairly certain that these didn\\'t sell well enough to keep making them, but I really enjoyed the setting and the story. Very cute.\\nMax Payne 3 – I\\'m the guy who\\'s never played a Max Payne game before so when I play this grimy, glitzy, greasy shooter I\\'m unburdened by Payne\\'s history. There\\'s no comparison to the way it used to be or the way I wanted a sequel to be. It\\'s just an awesome shooter with a dumb, but neat story. Brazil is here to stay as a setting and even though Rockstar characters are all deplorable assholes who I hate, I had a soft spot for Max and Giovanna. Pretty solid shooter.\\nSonic Generations – Modern Sonic games suck. All of them. Everyone who thinks Generations is \"not that bad\" or \"good\" is wrong. You\\'re wrong.\\nBIT.TRIP.RUNNER – A rhythm game! I didn\\'t realize it before I tried it. The first boss fight sucks and I stopped playing after it. I hear that was a mistake.\\nPersona 4 Arena – I got a little bogged down by being forced to play other perspectives before finishing the main narrative, but the continuation of the Persona story was solid enough to make me interested in the game, even if I didn\\'t really care for the fighting mechanic. Guys, who knew a fighting game could have a sweet story?\\nDriver: San Francisco – Didn\\'t get enough in to say anything definitive, but I don\\'t really like the car mechanics.\\nTrine 2 – I don\\'t think either of these Trine games are for me, but I\\'ve only ever played 5 hours of a Trine game ever. It\\'s the physics model. I don\\'t like the imprecision in a platformer. I had the same issue with Little Big Planet.\\nIron Brigade – The most frustrating networking experience of 2012. It\\'s a shame too because Min, Lee, and I should have loved playing this.\\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive – Goddammit I love me some Counter-Strike. I didn\\'t put that many hours into this, but playing it with Simon and some of the old War Cry guys was awesome. If you have any interest in shooters, but you don\\'t play this…well I don\\'t understand you.\\nOrcs Must Die 2 – Not the best tower defense game, but I think I\\'m under 10 hrs with it so maybe it picks up?\\nThe Last Story – Got so bogged down writing about this with David (remember that feature?) that I never continued it. Lots of promise there with characters that seem deeper than your usual anime bullshit, but I need to give it another 20 hours to be sure.\\nMark of the Ninja – The tightest stealth game (mechanics-wise) you will ever play. Seriously, man. It\\'s pretty boss. The story is fairly dumb, but playing it is so much fun that you can\\'t help but smile. A solid win in my book.\\nFTL: Faster Than Light – I\\'ve recorded 31.5 hours of me playing this game as of when I write this sentence. A game that has such tight mechanics that you can\\'t help but love it. This was the year of roguelikes for me. FTL plays like the space sim you always wish you had. I don\\'t see myself getting bored of this game until I unlock all the ships. That won\\'t be for a while because I\\'m somewhat terrible with some of the ships, but I do love me this game.\\nNew Super Mario Bros. 2 – More Mario platforming. Not the most inspired Mario game, but it has its moments. Not gonna set the world on fire and, like the first one, not my favorite Mario game.\\nTorchlight 2 – I can\\'t really claim to have played this game since the first day was a clusterfuck and I didn\\'t get past the menu screen. Had tons of fun chatting with Min and his cousin though.\\nBorderlands 2 – Until the very end of December I was the only one of my close video gaming friends who had this game. As a solo affair (and even as a group affair), the early parts of this game are pretty terrible/boring/tedious. In a group I\\'ve enjoyed playing this tons more. It\\'s just fun to have three friends rolling around Pandora with you. I hope we keep playing.\\nTheatrhythm: Final Fantasy – I love rhythm games. I love Final Fantasy music. This game is beautiful and perfect and could only be made better with more FF VI music.\\nKirby\\'s Dream Collection – Picked it up to own Kirby Super Star. Played a bit of that with Min. Lots of fun, but not gonna set the world on fire.\\nProfessor Layton and the Last Specter – Played it for a few minutes because it was the only sequel I could find in the store. Based on those few minutes I bought the rest of the franchise.\\nPokemon White Version 2 – I wish I hadn\\'t pushed Min and David to get Black and White because the Version 2s are so much better. There has never been a better put together Pokemon game. I\\'ve sunk over a hundred hours into this game playing it Nuzlocke style and I still have yet to defeat the Elite Four or Team Plasma. I\\'m not kidding, guys, this is the closest you can come to a perfect Pokemon game.\\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown – Ok, for realsies now, guys. This is the best game of the year. Just so much fun to play in Classic Ironman mode where every mistake is locked in place and humanity hangs in the balance. Tactical, turn-based combat has never been better implemented and every system works well. My only gripe is that you \"can\\'t fail\" the final mission in the sense that losing it sends you to the start. Losing an Ironman run in the final mission would be brilliant (and sadistic), wouldn\\'t it?\\nProfessor Layton and the Curious Village – It has a fairly ridiculous plot twist that almost makes zero sense and doesn\\'t hit with any oomph, but you\\'re supposed to be here for the puzzles anyway. They\\'re fun and the characters are charming enough that I\\'m more than happy to spend hours upon hours just completing brain teasers.\\nNeed for Speed: Most Wanted – I wish this was more Burnout Paradise instead. I don\\'t like the way the \"campaign\" is laid out with the unlocks for all the cars. I hate how I have to earn nitro every time I swap cars. It\\'s just not as good as the Burnout stuff. I\\'m sorry. That said, it\\'s so much fun to race at top speed in real-world automobiles. Super fun.\\nProfessor Layton and the Miracle Mask – The 365 puzzles (one a day) and the fact that I bought it digitally are what keeps me coming back to this game over and over again since I haven\\'t yet beaten the previous iterations. Solid puzzle work and a great 3DS package, but I can\\'t wait to actually see the narrative.\\nProfessor Layton and the Diabolical Box – More Layton, but on a train!\\nTo the Moon – The Walking Dead kind of ruined this game for me. Everyone was lauding it as this grand, mature narrative, but then The Walking Dead goes and does something truly spectacular while To the Moon failed to really hit with me. The twist was neat and I dug the story, but I didn\\'t find it to be as amazing as I\\'d heard. It\\'s solid storytelling in a mediocre engine package, but it\\'s worth checking out for sure.\\nHotline Miami – Certainly the game that\\'s inspired the most cackling laughter in me. Just brutal, ugly, sleazy, and weird. Hotline Miami has a kickass soundtrack and relentless gameplay. The bosses are kind of obnoxious, but it plays fairly sharply and I\\'d recommend it to almost anyone.\\nNintendo Land – Fantastic in group settings, but somewhat lacking as a solo endeavor. I\\'m happy to own it and I think asynchronous information/capabilities makes for way more interesting games than the same old stuff we\\'re used to, but without a group to play this it can get a little boring.\\nNew Super Mario Bros. U – Haven\\'t put a lot of time in it, but the course design is definitely superior to the DS version. Can\\'t wait to beat this with Min, but I\\'m not breaking down any doors to play it.\\nDonkey Kong Country Returns – I\\'m only two worlds in, but it feels slighter/weaker than the old DKCs. We\\'ll see how it pans out, I guess.\\nSleeping Dogs – I\\'m getting open world fatigue pretty early in this one. Unlike Saints Row: The Third, this is more serious and I feel like not being ridiculous is to its detriment. Sleeping Dogs\\' dating system is ridiculous and the cop story is fairly predictable, but I\\'m in love with the Hong Kong setting and the fact that this is a game not taking place in LA, NY, or Miami. Also really nice to see non-white protagonists. The Batman fighting style is neat, but, like I said, already hitting open world fatigue.\\n999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – I\\'m glad I played and finished this before the end of the year because it\\'s absolutely brilliant. Any game that uses the mechanics of the system its on is an instant plus for me and the final puzzle/revelation is brilliant. How many games make you think about morphic resonance and information transfer like this one? Just the fact that I found myself thinking about philosophical questions like Locke\\'s Socks/The Ship of Theseus and that it ALL MADE SENSE was really brilliant. Look, visual novels are divisive, but you shouldn\\'t let that get in your way. 999 has one of the neatest stories of the year (2010) and it\\'s easily one of my favorite games this year.\\n999: nine hours nine persons nine doors, bioware, bit.trip.runner, blizzard, borderlands 2, burnout paradise, cave story +, chrono cross, chrono trigger ds, counter-strike: global offensive, diablo, diablo ii, diablo iii, donkey kong country returns, dragon age 3, driver: san francisco, earthbound, fez, final fantasy xiii, final fantasy xiii-2, ftl: faster than light, ghost trick, greed corp, hotline miami, iron brigade, jamestown, kirby\\'s dream collection, mark of the ninja, mass effect 3, max payne 3, need for speed: most wanted, neon genesis evangelion, new super mario bros. 2, new super mario bros. u, nintendo land, no more heroes: heroes\\' paradise, orcs must die 2, penny arcade adventures: on the rain-slick precipice of, penny arcade adventures: on the rain-slick precipice of darkness 3, persona 4 arena, phoenix wright, pokemon white, pokemon white version 2, professor layton and the curious village, professor layton and the diabolical box, professor layton and the last specter, professor layton and the miracle mask, puzzle agent, rayman: origins, rhythm heaven fever, rockstar, saints row: the third, shadow complex, shin megami tensei: devil survivor, shin megami tensei: devil survivor 2, sins of a solar empire: rebellion, sleeping dogs, sonic generations, spelunky, starcraft ii: heart of the swarm, superbrothers: sword & sworcery ep, the binding of isaac, the last story, the wakling dead, theatrhythm final fantasy, to the moon, torchlight, torchlight 2, trine, trine 2, tropico 4, warcraft, xcom: enemy unknown\\nWhat I\\'ve Been Doing 30 Jan 2012 [FB/IB/F/BT/GO]\\nJan 30th, 2012 by Dan\\nHere\\'s a suggestion: If you\\'re playing Cave Story for the first time, don\\'t pick hard mode (Photo courtesy escaped.monkey)\\nBusy weekend with lots of media consumed. That kind of thing happens when I hang out with Min.\\nThe Descendants – Shailene Woodley was a revelation as Alex in this movie. Excellent acting. George Clooney was also quite good. Pretty chill movie and worth seeing, even if the land ownership subplot is kind of tacked on and not as interesting.\\nEvangelion 2.22 – I thought I\\'d seen this…but I hadn\\'t. I really missed seeing some of the fun/interesting battles of the old tv show. I mean, cutting Israfel in favor of a school drama plot about making Shinji lunch and a dinner party? I\\'d rather have that sequence instead. I also get that the movie doesn\\'t allow for the ponderous and deliberate psycho-analytic battle against Leliel, but it\\'s one of my faves so I was bummed about losing it too. Did not care for the new pilot, Mari, at all, and I didn\\'t love the business with mixing up who\\'s who in the battle against Bardiel, but, whatever, right? Some things are different. 2.22 makes me want to watch Neon Genesis Evangelion instead. The more relaxed pace allows for much greater character development and interesting concepts. We\\'ll see what happens with the rest of the movies and the new ending.\\nTangled – Min hadn\\'t seen this, it was on instant, and we were bored. It\\'s pretty great, but I hate the video quality of the Starz movies.\\nHaywire – Went to see this on Sunday and it cut out 40 minutes in. We could have either stayed to watch it from the beginning or taken a voucher for a new movie. As interested in seeing this as I was, I couldn\\'t stomach watching the slow opening 40 minutes again. I\\'ll either try again or wait for Netflix.\\nChildrens Hospital – Ward 8 and the children stabbing Nick Offerman with pencils was great. So was the Bob Seger joke to find out how old he was. Fantastic show. Can\\'t wait for a new season.\\nUp All Night – Megan Mullally and Shayna. So great. The bit about cheating on watching a TV show with your spouse was great. Super awkward.\\nGlee – Pretty interesting \"Summer Nights\" recreation, complete with the overlay in the climactic final note. I like songs like \"Wedding Bell Blues\", but the processed voices sound a lot like they don\\'t belong in the show. I guess it was a dream sequence Wow, making Artie move/act like Mick Jagger is surprisingly effective even though he\\'s in a wheelchair. Whoa…what?! The thing about Finn\\'s dad came out of NOWHERE.\\nJustified – I\\'m cool with case of the week stuff when it\\'s this good. Sometimes it\\'s ok for Raylan not to be the absolute center. I hope they get Carla Gugino on the show more. The other new villain is appropriately scary.\\nArcher – \"Cyril?\" \"No breakfast for you!\" Another great episode of Archer this week. I miss Ray as a field agent, but I guess this has a lot of comic potential.\\nParks and Recreation – The bit about Tom bowling like a grandma (and Ron begging him to have some decency as a man) was amazing. April being nice is unusual, but she\\'s been softening up a lot anyway. Still one of the greatest shows out there.\\nScrubs – Just put it on for a few minutes to pass some time. Always a good show.\\nSherlock – The middle episode about the Chinese smugglers is kind of boring, but the Moriarty episode is fantastic. I love how crazy Jim Moriarty is. So great.\\nJohn Oliver\\'s New York Stand Up Show – Popped this on during dinner for something to laugh to. Pretty good stuff.\\nThe Gregory Brothers – You know they put up a new Auto-Tune (Songify?) the News segment, so that got me listening to all of them again. I even dipped into their non-ATtN music because I love Sarah Gregory\\'s voice.\\nThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo – Slow and steady. Bloomqvist sure gets around with the ladies, doesn\\'t he?\\nThe Old Republic – The guild\\'s got Eternity Vault Normal on farm status so now it\\'s time to start working on Karagga\\'s Palace.\\nGhost Trick – Making a lot of progress in this game. The mystery continues to deepen as my Spanish continues to improve. I love playing games in Spanish!\\nEarthbound (Mother 2) – Started up a new save file to play in between bosses in a raid. Fun times. Still very early in the game (haven\\'t explored the meteor yet)\\nRayman: Origins – Min and I beat the game and started going for the prestige levels. Holy god the last one, Land of the Livid Dead, is about as punishing as the game can get. Platforming gets frustrating, but it\\'s also got a super satisfying feel once you conquer it.\\nCave Story + – Thought I\\'d boot up something different while Min was napping. This game is pretty fun and pretty solid, but deciding I should play it on hard mode may have been a mistake. I\\'m stuck on Monster X because he\\'s a beast. Every one of his purple projectiles kills me in one hit, so I\\'ve got to be perfect. On the good side of the spectrum, the machine gun mechanics are amazing. Love that gun and the ability to float with it.\\nBookmark This, Embedded Reporter, Feedback, Filmmakers Bleed, Game Overview, Idiot Box\\narcher, carla gugino, cave story +, children hospital, earthbound, evangelion 2.22, george clooney, ghost trick, glee, gregory brothers, haywire, john oliver, john oliver\\'s new york stand up show, justified, megan mullally, mother 2, neon genesis evangelion, netflix, nick offerman, parks and recreation, rayman: origins, sarah gregory, scrubs, shailene woodley, sherlock, star wars: the old republic, starz, tangled, the descendants, up all night\\nMay: You\\'ve Been Cheated [Fukubukuro 2010]\\nIn their last show as a band, the Sex Pistols played one song and left the stage.

I suppose we\\'ll go after the biggest point of contention first.\\n\"Final Fantasy XIII is The Worst Final Fantasy Ever (TM) because all the dungeons are straight lines and there are no towns.\" Guess what. The non-linearity of those Final Fantasy games you all hold so dear is an illusion. Final Fantasy XIII draws so much ire because it has the gall to tell you what you already know.\\nI mean, really, you might be able to wander around the world man, but that doesn\\'t mean you get to pick what you do. The plot only advances when you go to specific places in a particular sequence (also known as a linear progression) and locations on the map are artificially locked from transit by story gates.\\nIn fact, non-linearity is a joke across almost every video game. The main fun of any GTA game may not stem from following the story, but when you do decide to start on it, you will never be able to sequence break or do anything but follow it linearly to its conclusion. You might be able to pick which order you complete mission paths, but, with the exception of GTA IV, every event has a pre-determined outcome. If that\\'s not linearity, I don\\'t know what is.\\nI applaud a game that doesn\\'t try to conceal its story behind a veneer of faux choice. Final Fantasy games have only ever allowed choices once: The World of Ruin in FF VI. There are countless story details and sidequests to experience, but once you get Setzer, Edgar, and Sabin, you don\\'t have to see any of them. You\\'re free to grind and face Kefka at any point.\\nBonus points really should be awarded to FF XIII for having the guts to let its story carry the momentum, but they are immediately lost on their failed attempt to make anything remotely interesting happen.\\nForemost in my annoyance with the game is Hope\\'s subplot. In the first hour or so of gameplay, Snow, a big, earnest, stupid guy in the tradition of anime big, earnest, stupid guys, manages to get most of his ragtag squad killed, including Hope\\'s mother, standing up against the world\\'s government. Naturally, this infuriates Hope, who now desires revenge.\\nHypothetical: A man seems directly responsible for the death of your mother. Do you:\\n1. Stutter and stammer every time you see him\\n2. Stew silently while enjoying revenge fantasies every time you see him\\n3. Figure out some way to confront him (in rage or otherwise) the first chance you get.\\nMaybe I\\'m being presumptuous here, but unless you\\'ve got some sort of emotional disorder, option three seems like the healthiest and most logical choice. Hope is all about the first two options because he is a gigantic pain in the ass.\\nI don\\'t think this is the result of some kind of cultural difference. I mean, hey, I\\'m not the most emotionally open person. I don\\'t really go around sharing my feelings with everyone I know, but I\\'m pretty sure that if a man were responsible for killing my mom, he\\'d know about it ASAP. It\\'s got to be a contrivance (and an annoying one). Why are characters in media so unable to just open their mouths and talk? If writers think this is an effective way to build narrative tension, then I\\'ve got news for them. As a rule, if your characters are forced to behave like they\\'ve never interacted with another human being for your plot devices to work, said devices are cripplingly contrived.\\nHonestly, it\\'s just lazy writing and it removes me from the narrative. Maybe Hope has a Deep Dark Secret that makes him act so stupidly, but we never learn about it. The game goes out of its way to say that Hope has father issues to hand-wave away his social idiocy, but when we meet Papa Hope, we\\'re confronted with a loving father who seems to care very deeply about his son. Did I miss something somewhere? Someone seems to have dropped the ball.\\nYou know what, I think I know why this happened. Somewhere along the way the story gurus at Square Enix decided that many young men, their prime and target demographic, seem to have issues with their domineering fathers. Some of them wrote this detail on his character sheet. Somewhere else the scenario writers were coming up with how half of the player characters would unite and escape. They decided they\\'d meet at Hope\\'s mansion and Hope\\'s awesome dad would help them out. When you\\'ve got a game this massive and important, you\\'d think that these two teams would discuss these idiosyncrasies, right? How does such a glaring contradiction make it into the final build?\\nOne of my other big \"WTF?\" moments comes at the end of a sequence at an amusement park. Sazh struggles with whether or not to kill the traveling companion who has betrayed him. Pretty soon after that starts, the physical manifestation of his emotional conflict attacks him. For most characters, fighting their eidolons, as they are called, brings them emotional peace allowing them to understand their path. In this case in results in Sazh deciding to commit suicide. What. The. Fuck.\\nRepeating this same emotional pattern six times (one for each main character!) seems like it would get old fast. It does. Suicide does not freshen the experience. It makes no sense. We all know he\\'s not really dead because we just unlocked his summon!\\nIt\\'s a shame to see so many missteps in such a promising premise. Roll with me here. In the world of FF XIII there are two primary sentient beings: Humans and Fal\\'Cie (ignore the stupid name of the second species (typical Squeenix pretentious nonsense)). The FC, as I will now call them, are magical creatures specializing in producing food, power, or other more advanced functions. Unfortunately, the FC are split into two warring factions, Cocoon and Pulse. FC also have the terrifying ability to brand humans, saddling them with cryptic quests. Failing to complete these quests turns the human into a mindless monster cursed to wander the earth slowly solidifying until he finally petrifies and can no longer move. If they magage to succeed in their quest, they are transformed into crystals for eternity. Those in \"crystal sleep\" are not dead, but they are also not alive.\\nIt\\'s the perfect deconstruction of video game protagonists. Each character has a singular purpose. Failing will result in a fate worse than death and succeeding will result in the end of the narrative, dooming the characters to non-existence. The much maligned linear nature of the game represents their inability to turn away, especially when you learn that the antagonists have been helping you the whole time. The big bad wants the characters to kill him. For once the game realizes that its point is to be defeated by the player.\\nIf Squeenix hadn\\'t gone and relied on a deus ex machina ending like they had, the world would have ended with mankind and the FC extinct. It would have been brilliant.\\nHere\\'s another idea for the writers out there. If we have no idea (and no hint) a character can do something until you dramatically reveal it in the penultimate cutscene, it will feel cheap when you make the ending rely on that skill. Not to mention, of course, that the physics of arresting the momentum of a giant biome falling thousands of feet through the atmosphere would probably result in the deaths of nearly every inhabitant.\\nThis is all stacked upon the naive and bullheaded solution that our heroes come up with to counter the manipulative FC. Get this, their plan is to just keep going along the path hoping that something will save them from dooming themselves (ok, so it does, but that\\'s because of narrative bullshit). It makes my brain hurt in ways I cannot fathom. It\\'s idiotic.\\nNow we\\'re going to take a moment for a quick aside into my personal life that will invariably lead back into the game.\\nI don\\'t know what university was like for non-math-type majors, but for my ECE degree I was forced to read and watch tons of mathematical proofs. Invariably (math pun! (so lonely)) we\\'d reach a point where the professor would skip to the end of the proof and tell us students \"I\\'ll leave the rest of this proof as an academic exercise for you students\". When you\\'re the professor, you don\\'t have to waste your time doing the grunt work.\\nThat was quick, back to the game:\\nWhy are we forced to load the battle engine against enemies who are drastically weaker than the player\\'s party? What\\'s the point of that? The only time I\\'ve ever seen this problem intelligently avoided was when I played Earthbound. Once Ness is sufficiently more powerful than a given enemy, enemy encounters result in an instant KO. The battle engine isn\\'t loaded and XP and items are awarded as appropriate. The game surrenders a battle whose result is a foregone conclusion, saving you from wasting unnecessary time.\\nShouldn\\'t more games do this? Why do I have to load up the battle engine to complete a fight that lasts five to ten seconds? What does the game gain by forcing me to sit through this? It\\'s not like we\\'re strategically managing resources in this game (unlike, say, a Persona or Shin Megami Tensei game); the entire party is fully healed after every battle. So why not? Does Squeenix think that if we don\\'t sit through a five second battle while pushing \\'X\\' once we will be livid that the game is playing itself?\\nOf course, this makes even less sense when you think about the way the battle system works in FF XIII. There are two ways that you can fight: Auto-Attack and Abilities. If you select Auto, the AI will select a series of commands faster than you could based on the knowledge it has about the enemy you are facing. All you have to do is set the roles (Tank, DPS, Healer, Buffer/Debuffer) and the game will pick the most prudent course of action. It\\'s also streamlined to such a degree that if you die, all you\\'ve got to do is pick retry and you are respawned just outside the battle you just lost. It\\'s that easy.\\nFinal Fantasy XIII wants so badly to be a well-oiled machine, like a Disney ride pushing you toward the goal, that these time sinks become way more pronounced. Fighting with auto, like almost every player does, with your only responsibility being character roles can still be strategic and fun, but at a certain point I start to think, \"Why do I have to select auto every single round? Why can\\'t I just toggle it off when I need to change my tactics?\" It\\'s like the game asks me every turn if I still want it to play the game for me.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong here, XIII is not a bad game…or maybe it is. Perhaps FF XIII is a better experience than it is a game. You\\'ve got stunning cutscenes and top-notch voice acting combined with a game that mostly plays itself along a straight line. Almost sounds like a movie to me.\\nearthbound, final fantasy, final fantasy vi, final fantasy xiii, grand theft auto, grand theft auto iv, persona 3, shin megami tensei, square enix\\nMother 3 Review [Big N]\\nWallpaper courtesy Pet-Shop on DeviantArt\\nRuminations on video games as an art form – this could very well become a Mother 3 review. There will be spoilers here. Seriously, don\\'t read it if you want to play Mother 3 and not have the plot spoiled.\\nThere\\'s a trite comparison that floats around the internet almost every month that always gets my eyes rolling. Inevitably, someone will call such-and-such the Citizen Kane of video games or ask what the Citizen Kane is or claim that the medium is immature because we\\'ve yet to hit our Citizen Kane. It\\'s exhausting and, quite frankly, futile and stupid. To begin with, Citizen Kane opened with good reviews and was generally well-received, but it didn\\'t start to gain notoriety for ten years. It didn\\'t even make #1 on a top movies list until twenty years had passed. When the Citizen Kane of gaming hits (god I hate that phrase), we probably won\\'t know it for quite some time. The more important point is that movies and games are apples and oranges.\\nThe day that we stop worrying about whether books or movies are better than games at expressing a particular artist\\'s point of view is probably the day that we\\'ll realize that we\\'ve already got fine examples of games that are reflections of authorial control already. Brütal Legend was not a great game, but Tim Schafer\\'s hands are clearly evident all over it. Anyone who\\'s ever played one of Fumito Ueda\\'s games knows precisely how a game can effectively be used to bring out your emotions through simple mechanics. Goichi Suda (AKA Suda 51) has been making games that show clear, artistic direction through his use of bizarre symbols and incomprehensible plots for years. My point is, we\\'ve been here for a while.\\nYou may have heard of Shigesato Itoi, but chances are, you have no clue that he\\'s one of the most famous and respected men in Japan to such a degree that his dog was probably the most recognizable animal in the entire country for a few years. In America, we know him as a video game designer, specifically the man behind Earthbound, but not much else. Interestingly enough, Itoi is actually more famous for being an essayist, interviewer, and slogan generator than his work for Nintendo. His association with Hayao Miyazaki is well known enough that he\\'s famous for the Kiki\\'s Delivery Service slogan (\"Ochikondari mo shita kedo, watashi wa genki desu\" — \"I was a little depressed for a bit; I\\'m okay now\") and he even voiced Mei\\'s father in My Neighbor Totoro (a role that went to Phil Hartman (rest in peace) when the movie was dubbed in English).\\nIn his younger days, Itoi found himself sick and unable to do much but play Nintendo as he recovered. It was in this state that he discovered Dragon Quest, which set the wheels turning in his head. This experience was the impetus behind the Mother series and led to Itoi\\'s long, fruitful relationship with Nintendo. In case you were wondering (protip: you probably weren\\'t), Shigesato Itoi is the guy who came up with the name for the Game Boy. True fact.\\nIt\\'s not surprising to me that most of the names I\\'ve mentioned were not always video game designers. The most bizarre of the bunch, Suda, was an undertaker before he tried his luck in the video game industry while Ueda was an artist and the aforementioned Itoi was a…well there\\'s no easy word to describe someone like Itoi. He was (and is) a cultural personality.\\n\"If you immerse yourself too single-mindedly in your chosen art form, whether it\\'s video games, movies, comics or whatever,\" he continues, \"your work can easily become just a reflection of what others are doing in that field, rather than breaking new ground.\"\\n–Jordan Mechner\\nNow, Schafer is, himself, a product of the industry, having held no other jobs, but he\\'s the exception, a true creative mind that is not crippled by his feedback loop of doom. Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Psychonauts, and Brütal Legend could not be more different from each other, but just think of how rare this is. For every Schafer or Ken Levine out there trying to bring new influences into the industry, there are tons of Star Wars- and Lord of the Rings-inspired games produced each year retreading on the same, tired stories game in and game out. How many World War II games do we really need?\\nIn 1989 Shigesato Itoi looked at the video game industry and said \"How many sword and sorcery RPGs do we really need?\" 2009 just passed us by and I\\'d say we\\'re still mostly mired in these medieval locales in 95% of all RPGs. Mother, Itoi\\'s freshman attempt at a video game, was set in \"modern day\" America. Earthbound (Mother 2) wasn\\'t exactly breaking with Itoi\\'s norm by being set in America yet again (in 1994), but it\\'s still a light among the sameness that pervaded the industry. Mother 3 is ambiguous about its timeline, but it feels like a scaled back modern day. In any case, like in the other games of the series, the weapons aren\\'t swords and bows, but sticks, yo-yos, and baseball bats. It\\'s really only a cosmetic and tonal shift, but it makes all the difference.\\nThat\\'s exactly what makes Shigesato Itoi so great as a game designer. Perhaps it\\'s his outside status or maybe it\\'s just his brilliance, but Itoi understands video games to a scary degree for a man who only undertook them on a whim. I applaud him most for understanding that a game is an interactive piece of art and reflecting that with his systems. To with, every Mother game revolves around music. The first game had the character searching for the Eight Melodies while the second repeated that idea with Eight Sanctuaries (each with a musical theme associated with it). Earthbound\\'s instruction manual (in Japanese) contained a little song that Itoi wrote for the player to sing as the main melody played on the overworld. Every line of text in the Mother series is written in kana (katakana or hiragana), so that the person has to vocalize Itoi\\'s often lyrical writing style. Mother 3\\'s focus on musical themes and leifmotifs (from the Masked Man to the Magypsies) is also emphasized through every character\\'s attacks in the battle system.\\nFrom Lucas to Salsa the Monkey, every character has a musical instrument associated with his attacks. So does every enemy. Each enemy also has a musical theme that plays in the background. Once you attack, you can continue to press the \\'A\\' button to extend your combo to 16 hits if you can keep time with the (sometimes fiendishly difficult) beat. Just like that, something Itoi has always wanted the player to do (become musically involved with his world) becomes integrated into the activity the player does most in the game, battling.\\nItoi also loves to toy with player perception to a hilarious degree. In an early sequence in the first chapter of the game, Flint becomes covered with soot after saving a friend\\'s kid from a fire. Why? Because that\\'s what would happen if you were running around in a fire. As he makes his way back out of the woods, you can bet that every person you talk to will question why you are covered from head to toe in black soot. Even better, if you hop into a hot spring to recover, the soot will wash off of your character from the neck down, since the Mother 3 hot spring animation always leaves the head exposed. It\\'s not until much later when it starts to rain that the soot washes off Flint\\'s face, this time to emphasize that we\\'re not joking around anymore, Flint\\'s family was still missing after the fire and they were almost certainly in danger.\\nAn even more brilliant sequence comes much later in the game when the player is washed upon a tropical island with 1 HP and no equipment. The only way to progress through the jungle without dying is to eat one of the psychotropic mushrooms growing on the island. A bizarre sequence of events follows as you make your way to the next Magypsy with your perceptions completely torn asunder. Replicas of your family and friends attack you, which isn\\'t that unique for an RPG, but the way the narrative is presented and the visuals are warped, it becomes seriously unsettling. The one moment of calm comes when you arrive at another hot spring and recover, only to continue back into the horrors of the jungle.\\nOnce you get to the Magypsy\\'s house, you\\'re constantly bombarded with insults about how bad you smell. It makes no sense though, because the player has done nothing different that would cause such a foul smell. Still, when your perception is returned to normal, there is a visible stench rising from Lucas and his compatriots. A quick dip in the bath follows and you\\'re no longer \"smelly\", but, as a curious player, I wondered what had happened in the first place. Instead of continuing forward, I dove right back into the jungle to get to the bottom of it. halfway through, I was feeling a bit fatigued, so I popped on over to the hot springs and it all made sense. In my hallucinogenic state, I was unable to recognize that the pond I dove into for recovery was a festering, toxic-looking garbage dump of a pond. Off to the side, where no conceivable player would ever go, was a door into the real hot spring.\\nI couldn\\'t believe that some players would never find out the mystery behind why they were so smelly. Returning to that hot spring is hardly mandatory. Maybe that\\'s why it felt so amazing to see these little narrative games played with my perception of what was going on in the Mother 3 world at the time. It\\'s also interesting to look at from a player trust perspective, because when I saw that disgusting pond, rendered in all its GBA, low-fi glory, I felt nauseous and I know it was partly due to a feeling of betrayal. I have a feeling that this was exactly how Itoi wanted me to feel at that point.\\nShigesato Itoi admits that the original draft for Mother 3 was way darker than it already is. It was written shortly after his divorce was finalized, which I think has a lot to do with the emotional betrayals of even the finalized version of this game. However this game was very nearly vaporware that was never released. Its development started for the SNES in 1994, but was quickly shifted to the N64 and the ill-fated 64DD not long after. Anyone familiar with the 64DD peripheral knows that this was going to prove troublesome for Itoi and his team. The game was even canceled at one point, but it was eventually decided to put it on the Game boy Advance and announced around the re-release of Mother 1 + 2, no doubt to help drum up sales.\\nNo one but the team knows just how dark the original narrative was, but Itoi claims that the story that eventually made it to print was the result of him finally becoming a good person. It boggles the mind to realize that it could have been any more dramatic, especially for a game that looks as friendly and cute as this one. In fact, this is the reason why Nintendo of America claims it will not localize the game. They claim the narrative is too mature and depressing for the way it looks and, really, the tone and the subject matter are alternatively irrelevant and deathly serious, so I kind of get what they mean. At one point you have a guy telling Flint that he\\'s got good news and bad news. The good news is something irrelevant and stupid while the bad news is that Flint\\'s wife, Hinawa, is dead. What follows is a scene that is so emotionally gripping that my little brother was affected even without hearing the music and sound associated with the scene. Flint completely flips out and starts beating on the guy who gave him bad news and even starts lashing out at the townspeople who are trying to calm him down. He is knocked out by a friend and put in a jail cell that has never before been used in the town\\'s existence.\\nIt\\'s this weird juxtaposition of the inane and the deathly serious that creates the dissonant feelings I mentioned before with the hot tub scene and makes the player feel uneasy about what\\'s going on. When Hinawa\\'s father, Alec, is trying to tell stupid jokes to help Flint not be so tense about the certain danger his son is in. I wanted to tell him to shut up and let him focus, but I could also see that Flint was obsessing to a dangerous degree and that Alec was right in trying to calm him down. You also have the lighthearted love story of Salsa and Samba being ruined by the brutal and sadistic torturer Yokuba (Fassad in the fan-translation). It\\'s like Itoi is trying to say that the world is a screwed up place, but you can\\'t let it get you down.\\nI\\'ll tell you right here, I\\'m a huge sucker for any story about brothers. Later on in the game, it becomes fairly obvious that Mother 3 starts to center around the struggle of twin brothers Lucas and Clause as they attempt to collect more plot coupons than the other. The game series is called Mother for a reason and this one in particular focuses on the differences between each of Hinawa\\'s boys and how they came to deal with her untimely death. While Lucas comes out of his shell and becomes a healthier, more assertive and confident boy despite his absentee father, Clause foolishly rushes out for vengeance and finds himself enslaved by the Pig Army in its quest to end the world. The climactic final battle reunites the family once again, but the reunion is bittersweet. Clause has almost killed Flint and Lucas must face him alone to the death, even though he\\'s yet to realize that the Masked Man is his brother. Once the mask is knocked off and Lucas is staring into his own face (they are twins after all), the battle becomes a masterpiece. Selecting attack will cause Lucas to intentionally pull his punches or miss his attacks completely. Sometimes he\\'ll even refuse to comply. Clause, having lost most of his humanity, will continue to attack until Hinawa begins pleading for him to stop. Eventually, Clause comes to his senses and realizes that Lucas is his brother and that he is no longer anything close to himself. At that point, Clause commits suicide in a peculiar way. It becomes apparent that the Courage Badge that Flint gave to Lucas (via a Mr. Saturn in another example of absentee parenting) is actually a Franklin Badge, an item that repels lightning in the Mother world.\\nThe heartbreaking thing about this whole sequence is that there\\'s nothing the player can do once Clause decides that he must kill himself to save the world. Lucas may not be physically (or psychically) killing his brother, but there\\'s nothing he can do but watch his brother kill himself using an item that he is holding. When it\\'s all over and Clause is dying in Lucas\\' arms with Flint nearby and Hinawa\\'s ghost above them, the reunion is finally completed and the family is happy for a brief second before both Clause and Hinawa depart the world leaving Lucas to pull the last plot coupon. The world literally ends and it all fades to black. Everyone (who was alive before) is still alive in the finale, but the world is darkness and it\\'s not made clear what the true outcome of the whole battle was. We do know that the world is safe and everyone makes it, but not much else beyond that, it\\'s left to the player to decide, I guess.\\nIf you want to really see a strangely tragic, chilling ending for a character, consider the fate of Porky, the antagonist in the game. The conflict in this game is motivated by his desire to see the world end. Porky\\'s mind was so warped by Giygas in Earthbound that he has remained in a permanent immature, childlike state even though he is now hundreds of years old. His influence corrupts and nearly destroys everything about the idyllic and peaceful Tazmily village and he is the one responsible for sapping Clause of all of his humanity. In his final encounter with Lucas, when it becomes apparent that he will not win the battle, he encases himself in the Absolutely Safe Machine, a capsule that renders him absolutely safe from all attacks both interior and exterior. Because it was just a prototype, there was no way to escape it, meaning that the ageless Porky can never die, but he can never leave the capsule nor can he communicate with anyone on the outside. For someone like Porky, an agent of entropy like the Joker in The Dark Knight, this is truly an ending worse than death. When all is dead and gone, when the universe dies of heat death, when existence is nothingness, Porky will still exist, alone in that capsule. It gives me chills just to think about it.\\nThere\\'s so much about this game that just doesn\\'t quite add up and leaves the player feeling strange about the relationships they are seeing. Duster, the limping thief, is very clearly verbally and probably physically abused by his father, Wess, yet they seem to be a team and there does seem to be some love there. It\\'s unsettling on all levels because Itoi wants to take the player from comfortable and happy to uneasy and sad throughout the whole game.\\nGames like this, they make me appreciate things, like my family and my life, and think about things, like the nature of society and happiness. I\\'m being simplistic here, but my point is this, what is art? Wikipedia calls it, \"…the process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way that appeals to the senses or emotions.\"\\nSo I say yet again, why are we questioning whether or not video games are art? Wake up and smell the sunflowers.\\nBig N\\nbig n, brütal legend, citizen kane, dragon quest, earthbound, fumito ueda, game boy, gba, goichi suda, hayao miyazaki, ichiro suzuki, ken levine, kiki\\'s delivery service, lord of the rings, maniac mansion: day of the tentacle, mother, mother 1 + 2, mother 3, my neighbor totoro, n64, phil hartman, psychonauts, shigesato itoi, snes, star wars, the dark knight, the secret of monkey island, tim rogers, tim schafer, wikipedia\\nWhat Next?

A little about each of the choices:\\nEarthbound (Mother 2)\\nA fantastic, Dragon Quest-inspired RPG series by Shigesato Itoi, Earthbound is fantastic, quirky, and interesting. I played this back when I was in middle school, but I think it deserves reexamining. Ideally I would be hooking up my SNES, which I still have, to get this to work, so that would be an adventure in and of itself.\\nSuikoden Tierkreis\\nI\\'ve never played any of Konami\\'s Suikoden RPG series, but this DS gaiden-type story is said to have a pretty neat narrative.\\nUniversally hailed by nearly every human being who has played it, this game is held in such high regard that it was featured in Reign Over Me because its themes of loss and regret actually coincided with those of the movie. I can only go on without playing a game by Ueda for so much longer.\\nMother 3\\nHeld in super-high regard by the likes of Tim Rogers, among many others, the third of the Mother series is chock full of the same light irreverence of Mother 2, but coupled with a somber, deep, dark, heavy story that is sure to tug at the heartstrings.\\nChrono Trigger DS\\nThe DS remake of my favorite 16-bit game, you can\\'t really go wrong with CT. Developed by a dream team collaboration between Square and Enix before they were Square Enix (Squeenix!), Chrono Trigger was the swan song of the 16-bit JRPG.\\nFinal Fantasy IV DS\\nThe Final Fantasy whose release immediately preceded (in the US) my favorite in the series, FFIV has eluded completion from me on multiple rentals.

Today, we examine another three, all of them the superb 16-bit RPGs.\\nYou know the drill by now about the \"Table of Honor\" and whatnot, so let\\'s just get down to the clue and game:\\nThis first game I want to examine jumps out at you from the world of platforming. You might doubt his ability to manage, but once he jumps, you\\'re filled with utmost confidence. Yeah, it\\'s Mario\\'s RPG debut, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.\\nRunner-up: Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars\\nFor some crazy reason, nobody in the Mushroom Kingdom will believe that you are Mario. You\\'re probably the most famous savior of the land, but it\\'s not your dashing mustache or your red overalls that will prove your identity, it\\'s your trademark jump. This running gag is probably my absolute favorite part about SMRPG. No matter what part of the world you\\'re in, someone will inevitably ask if you are really the plumber. The dialog will pause, you will be unable to do anything else until you finally push the jump button and prove your identity.\\nThe rest of the game is full of comparable humor and character that exude from every pore. Dialog makes sense and is pretty slick, the story is actually not that bad for what you\\'d expect it to be, and, most importantly, that trademark tight gameplay that Squaresoft has always been known for makes for a great battle system and actually meshes pretty well with Mario\\'s more typical platforming roots. Battle returned to the more traditional turn-based type affair, but now your special attacks were powered up by timed button presses or other similar tests of button-pressing acumen. This system was so slick and exciting that every subsequent Mario RPG (sadly none of them Squaresoft created) and even the new Penny Arcade Adventures has got timed button presses for defense and interesting special attacks.\\nI\\'m sure that many were skeptical about SMRPG\\'s ability to be a valid, entertaining game when it was announced. Just adding a big-name RPG developer to a franchise character does not make everyone believe it will rock (just look at Sonic Chronicles, no one thinks it will succeed). That SMRPG is able to succeed on all fronts and still be one of the better RPGs on the console is a testament to the talent of old-school Squaresoft. What a great game…\\nI just can\\'t resist throwing in yet another video game commercial for this game. This one\\'s quite bizarre…\\nThis next game was published in America by a company whose motto is \"Serious Fun,\" but it\\'s not the farming sim/RPG that you might be thinking of. The main character fights very sinister beings in order to save the world in this one. This one\\'s a bit tougher, but it\\'s Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals.\\nRunner-up Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals\\nThis one might fall a bit outside of most of your game radars. It\\'s not A-list like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, not even B-list like Breath of Fire or the Secret of series (you can bitch and moan all you want about this, but you\\'ll never convince me that the Seiken Densetsu series is anything more than B-list). Lufia is a pretty firm C-list series, with regards to RPG popularity. There were two SNES games games and one gbc game in the series canon, with another gbc gaiden. That\\'s it, that\\'s the entire series. To be fair, it was mostly concluded with the GBC game, but I feel that they did leave it slightly open-ended.\\nGameplay isn\\'t that special, it\\'s your typical RPG with turn-based battles. There was one notable battle mechanic in the capsule monsters that you could capture and have fight on your team. These monsters were computer controlled and could be leveled up and evolved by feeding them weapons and armor. The interesting thing is that this idea came about a full year before Pokémon was released. Pretty cool if you ask me.\\nWhat does make this game stand out and what earns it a spot on this list was its story. As a prequel in a time before prequels were cool (this was way back in Japan in 1995), Lufia II picked up the story before the events of Lufia & the Fortress of Doom (a game I never played). You were Maxim and, like most RPGs, you are told by a mysterious figure (a woman named Iris in this case) that you are destined to save the world. You head out to solve a monster problem for your village with your childhood friend Tia (you reluctantly bring her along) and from there you bounce from town to town solving problems and adding the brutally strong Guy to your party. Iris saves your life after you learn about the Sinistrals and you go on to add another party member, the female soldier Selan, before you finally learn the identity of the first Sinistral, Gades, after he brutally destroys an entire town.\\nExcited yet? Your party certainly is. They set off to confront Gades and make him pay for what he\\'s done. He responds by soundly kicking your ass. In yet another video game \"oh shit, I hope I was supposed to die\" moments, you are revived by Iris who revives the party and tells everyone but Tia that they are meant to confront this evil light with Maxim. Another dude, Dekar, joins the party and Maxim, Guy, and Dekar head out to kill Gades after learning from a lieutenant of the Sinistrals, Idura, that Gades plans on sinking an entire island. This time Maxim manages to kill Gades, but he still manages to activate the machine after all. Maxim heroically gets to the machine on his own, but deactivating it mostly kills him in the process. Iris teleports in, decides to be useful, and saves Maxim.\\nIn the aftermath of this event, we are treated to a touching cutscene where Ti– no, wait, Selan (?) confesses her love for Maxim. I still remember this plot point coming straight from left field. You mean to tell me that Tia, who\\'s been hitting on you this whole game, isn\\'t gonna end up with Maxim? As a player, I didn\\'t mind, since Tia was annoying and Selan was arguably hotter (in that 16-bit way), but still, it really messed with me to see the developers not take the easy road, and I respect them for it. Tia honorably realizes she\\'s not gonna win Maxim\\'s love, tells Dekar that she loves Maxim the man, not Maxim the warrior, and sets off to find a man as good as Maxim to marry. That\\'s seriously the last you see of a character you\\'ve spent hours developing. The game sort of \"ends\" here as Maxim and Selan are married, buy a little house, and have a kid.\\nIf you couldn\\'t guess by now, I\\'m a fan of these drastic world- or game-changing events in a video game. Be it the loss of Naked Snake\\'s right eye in MGS3 and how it affects first-person view from then on or something like the World of Ruin, these huge, irreversible events never cease to amaze me (I guess, if Iabsolutely have to I\\'ll admit that Aeris\\' death is kind of cool in that way, but it never really had the same emotional impact on me as any of these other ones). Here I am, yet again thinking that I beat the game, and then Idura kidnaps your son and you\\'re forced to take up arms again. Iris comes in and claims that it was Maxim\\'s fate to die after the battle with Gades, but her actions have changed the future. As the gamer, you don\\'t yet know that these are lies. Heck, you don\\'t even know the huge twist yet at all (maybe you might if you had played the first game, but I certainly didn\\'t).\\nYou do more quest-y stuff, Dekar dies after you kill Idura, and eventually you get to the final confrontation with the Sinistrals which is, not coincidentally, precisely the way that Lufia & the Fortress of Doom opens, which means that you fight the Sinistrals and kill three of the four. While trying to escape, only Guy and the elf Artea (he joined you in the second half) make it out alive. Maxim and Selan die, but are forever remembered as the heroes who vanquished the Sinistrals. It also turns out that this whole time your \"helper\" Iris was the Sinistral Erim. Erim is unique in that so long as she lives, the Sinistrals can be continually reincarnated. Also unique about her is her ability to take on human form, which some fans speculate is a result of the Sinistral Daos testing humanity. The real twist here is that Iris/Erim is later reincarnated as one of the main characters in the first Lufia game. By the way, you\\'re probably wondering why this game is even called Lufia if there are no characters named Lufia anywhere in the game. I can see your brains connecting the dots. Lufia is Erim and she is a character who fits a similar role to Tia in the first Lufia game to one of Maxim\\'s descendants. She didn\\'t change history by allowing Maxim to continue his bloodline, for Maxim and his descendants were always meant to counter and eventually defeat the Sinistrals. Erim makes one final appearance as a party member in the third Lufia game, as she gathers up yet another of the bloodline of Maxim and a crew of strong warriors. She builds them up this final time to destroy the Sinistral menace forever. Erim had tired of life as the Sinistral of Death and wanted her life to finally end.\\nI should also mention that Lufia II had a pretty solid puzzle and monster mechanic. Monsters appeared on the field and got to move every time you moved. There were also some pretty neat and difficult puzzles for the player to solve as he made his way through the many dungeons. I distinctly remember some of these being so tough (this is good!) that I had to consult old issues of Nintendo Power to figure out how to progress.\\nThere you have it, a fairly convoluted plot and a game that\\'s ultimately average in its battle execution. Still, I can\\'t help but love Lufia II for it\\'s creative puzzles and that zany story. Prequels were still a pretty new concept to me back then when I played it and knowing what was to happen to Maxim and Selan made for some interesting, if fatalistic gameplay as I watched the drama unfold. There\\'s something cool about playing a game that fits into a pre-determined timeline. It\\'s both futile and awesome to fill in the details of a future you know will one day occur. I\\'d like to see more games try this with their storylines. Have a sage/oracle-type character tell you that completing the game will lead to your death. It could be fourth-wall or even within the game itself. Watching the main character grapple with what he knows to be the greater good at the expense of the personal good leads to good drama. They did it in FF VI with Terra, but the devs didn\\'t have what it took to let her die and not have a happy ending. That may be a good thing anyway, since I\\'m one of the few people who can be satisfied with an unhappy or unfair ending.\\nThe Japanese commercial for this game is pretty lame, so here\\'s something that a fan put together for the 11-year anniversary of the game:\\nYeah, the video\\'s not that cool, but it gives you a taste of what the game looked and played like. If you ever get a chance to play this game, I do recommend it. It\\'s well worth your time.\\nOur last game of the day had a mother of a time even getting released in America. To this day, the first and third game of this series have still never seen the light of American day. If you\\'re a fan of the Runaway Five, you also already know that I\\'m talking about EarthBound.\\nRunner-up: EarthBound\\nThe brilliance of EarthBound lies not in its genre, but more in the originality and character that it brings to an already tired formula. How many sword and sorcery-themed RPGs does the video game market really need? (Answer: Don\\'t be stupid, sword and sorcery-themed RPGs rock!) Still, it\\'s refreshing to see an RPG take place in a modern setting like the country of Eagleland (a not-so-veiled reference to the USA). It\\'s hilarious to see that your weapons consist of baseball bats, yo-yos, and bottle rockets.\\nThe story centers around Ness, a boy of tremendous psychic power who is tasked by a bee from the future named Buzz Buzz to destroy the evil force known as Giygas. Ness sets out from his hometown, Onett, and encounters and recruits Paula, Jeff, and Poo to save the planet. Along the way, they fight cultists, zombies, dogs, ninjas, bails out the Runaway Five twice, and eventually have their souls transferred into a robotic body to enable them to travel in time to fight Giygas. It\\'s strange, but in a quirky way. Even the final boss isn\\'t your typical encounter. You defeat the mighty Giygas by repeatedly praying, eventually getting the entire planet to unite and defeat Giygas in a Dragon Ball spirit bomb-type fashion.\\nEarthBound makes this list (just barely) because of the character that it exudes from every pore. Destroying the Happy-Happy cult is still one of my favorite situations in a video game mainly because of how bizarre it really is. Another plus for EarthBound is that it\\'s really hard. The game definitely doesn\\'t pull any punches with its difficulty.\\nUnfortunately for us US EarthBound fans, the series didn\\'t sell all to well when it first came out for the SNES. As a result, Nintendo decided not to release the sequel, Mother 3 (EarthBound = Mother 2), stateside citing poor sales of EarthBound. No matter how many fan campaigns Starman.net tries to put together to bring Mother 3 to North America, Nintendo continuously refuses to release. Interestingly enough, the Nintendo of America guys actually love the Starman dudes, which I think is what has allowed the Starmen to still have a Mother 3 fansub in production without a cease-and-desist order being issued.\\nMany fans speculate that EarthBound\\'s upcoming release on the Virtual Console (it was rated by the ESRB => it will be coming out) will be a barometer to test the validity of releasing Mother 3 in Eagleland. You can bet that the day this game comes out anyone, and I do literally mean anyone, who is on my Wii friends list will receive a gift of EarthBound for the SNES unless they tell me they\\'re planning on buying it already. I just want to drum up sales because I\\'d love to see Mother 3 hit our shores.\\nYet another Japanese commercial that doesn\\'t make too much sense.

But what does that mean for the \"home team\"? What role does the club play for the next generation of Austrian jazz musicians, regionally and abroad? ARIANNA FLEUR sat down with CHRISTOPH HUBER, co-founder and director of the renowned Viennese jazz club, Porgy & Bess, to talk about the past, present and, especially, the future of Austrian jazz and improvized music, and who we should all be keeping our eyes and ears open for in the months and years to come.\\nSo, it\\'s widely known that the Porgy stage has long had the privilege and honor of hosting the best players in jazz and beyond. But, it\\'s a 2-way street, isn\\'t it? Not only do you bring in international talent, but you also help launch regional musicians outwards.\\nChristoph Huber [laughs]: Yeah, I have to agree!\\nOne could even say, playing at your club is something of an entrance ticket to the jazz world beyond. In other words, you\\'d be hard pressed to find an internationally relevant Austrian jazz musician who hasn\\'t played at Porgy and, most likely, played there 1st, before venturing out beyond the Austrian borders. What do you think about this statement?\\nChristoph Huber: Well, who wrote that? I love it. [laughs] But seriously, yes, it\\'s true. You know, the point was, from the beginning, when we – Mathias Rüegg, Renald Deppe, Gabriele Mazic and myself – started Porgy in 1993, our mission was three-fold: 1st and foremost, the Austrian scene, 2nd the European one and, 3rd, the big names from the American scene, which is the homeland of jazz.\\n(c) Wolfgang Gonaus\\new AIM TO BE SOMETHING OF A MEETING PLACE FOR MUSICIANS, AS WELL AS A MEETING PLACE FOR PROJECTS THAT COULD DEVELOP TOGETHER\\nIs that still the mission today?\\nChristoph Huber: Yes, this \"triad\" concept hasn\\'t changed. Of course there have been developments and focuses on other international regions, but basically it\\'s the same. What we aim for is, on one side, to be something of a meeting place for musicians, but on the other, a meeting place for projects that could develop together. For example, inviting international musicians to collaborate with Austrian musicians, as we do in our Portrait Series. So we not only offer the audience to check out the American cats or internationally interesting acts, but also to interact with them. Not every day, of course, but in certain projects.\\nIt sounds like the club helps the Austrian scene to expand their international connections.\\nChristoph Huber: In fact, that\\'s something we feel to be our task. I mean, the Portraits are still happening. We invite international artists, but, meanwhile, we also invite the next generation of Austrian musicians like pianist Georg Vogel or bassist Manu Mayr.\\nSo international collaborations have always been one of the pillars of Porgy, but due to the pandemic, things shifted dramatically and from one day to the next, the club\\'s content suddenly became almost exclusively regional. Do you think that this has long-term implications for you or the music world at large, or was it just an exceptional situation?\\nChristoph Huber: It\\'s an exceptional situation. But, the local scene was always a huge part of the program. And, you know, we have the Strenge Kammer, for example, which is closed now due to the pandemic. So, in our streaming program, we featured a lot of bands that had previously played at the Strenge Kammer. Of course, when everything reopens, some of the bands that played on the main stage may have to go back to the Strenge Kammer. But, you know, the whole program won\\'t really change that much. It\\'s just, the competition will be tougher.\\nSo, how do you actually make your program? How do you choose your artists? And where do you get your information, especially when it comes to upcoming artists who aren\\'t that big yet?\\nBeate Wiesinger & Lisa Hofmaninger (c) Eckhart Derschmidt\\nChristoph Huber: I don\\'t really have a system. It just happens. But, mostly, I find out about new acts by word of mouth or recommendation. For example, when Christoph Cech, who was the director of the jazz department of the Bruckner Conservatory, says a name and that they are a big talent, then I know I don\\'t have to second guess it. Of course, one also picks up a lot through the longstanding network of festival and club owners. This makes programming quite easy. And a lot of things happen through Renald Deppe\\'s very careful programming of the Strenge Kammer.\\nSo who are the up and coming Austrian musicians which definitely will not be bumped from the main stage, and beyond that are, in your opinion, ready to hit the international stage, or hit it even harder if they already have?\\nChristoph Huber: To be honest, there are quite a lot. Even if you just think about instruments, like bass players for example. You will find at least 10 super high-level bass players in Austria, like Judith Ferstl, for example, with really spectacular musicianship. And that\\'s changed a lot. When I started Porgy in the 90\\'s, the scene was quite small. Since then, a lot has developed, like the level of education. You now have fantastic teachers, like (Wolfgang) Puschnig, for example, who really come out of the international jazz scene. So there are a lot of very talented and well-educated students, like Georg Vogel, for example. When he plays this 31-tone Claviton, you go crazy. [laughs] You think, wow what\\'s that? Or this piano player David Six, or the Wiesinger sisters (Astrid, sax & Beate, bass), the band, Purple is the Color, or the drummer Judith Schwarz. They\\'re all on their way.\\nTHE IDEA WAS TO SUPPORT THE YOUNG, ADVANCED AUSTRIAN SCENE\\nYou mentioned Georg Vogel, which I half expected, because he\\'s on a lot of people\\'s minds in the jazz and improvisation scene lately. But you also said how complex his work is. Where could he fit on the international stage?\\nChristoph Huber: Let\\'s compare him with a historical figure like Cecil Taylor. He was also kind of a nerd, in a good way. It took him a while to succeed with this kind of art, because it\\'s so complex. So of course that\\'s a challenge. On the other side, when Georg is doing his piano trio, it\\'s also quite complex, but it\\'s easier to listen to.\\nCan you tell me what you know and like about Purple is the Color?\\nChristoph Huber: Well, they started at the Strenge Kammer and played there a couple of times, until we realized, wow, that\\'s a really cool and interesting collective. They are a quartet, and all studied together, I believe. And when you see a band working together for some time and they always get better and better, and they develop and really stick together, then you can see their potential. And once you recognize that, then you will give them the main stage, of course. But it needs time to develop. It\\'s not good to give them the main stage right away.\\nSo, for that reason the Strenge Kammer really makes sense.\\nChristoph Huber: Totally. That was the point of it. We started the Strenge Kammer about 10 years ago. And the idea was to support the young, advanced Austrian scene, for who the main stage was too big. We have a certain pressure there. We need to fill the seats. That\\'s just how it is. So the Strenge Kammer makes sense, and of course it is like the first step to Porgy. When you get a gig at the Strenge Kammer, it\\'s the first chance you have to attract my attention and others\\'. Normally that works pretty well, and afterwards you might get a gig at the main stage. And if that happens, it can really help musicians get gigs abroad. The truth is, other international clubs look to our program to help make decisions about their own.\\nDo you have any advice for musicians who are early in their career? When you spoke about Purple is the Color it sounded like, in part, what convinced you is how convinced they were of themselves.\\nChristoph Huber: Absolutely. You have to follow your idea or intention. If you have a strong idea of what you want to do and it doesn\\'t work out immediately, don\\'t simply give up. If this idea is not only a strong idea, but a good one too, and you stick with it, at one point, you will be recognized for it. But you have to keep going and develop it. I mean, if a concept doesn\\'t work out in the first moment, it\\'s not a big deal. You just have to shape it and work on it. You need time to rehearse, practice and experiment.\\nIt\\'s not always easy, though, to have this kind of self-assuredness. Especially in a culture for which these values are not as deeply engrained as, let\\'s say, the American one.\\nChristoph Huber: No, it\\'s not easy. It\\'s a hard way of course. But it makes sense. I mean, if you want to survive as a front-person, then you can\\'t take the easy route. But at one point, you know, all those really talented musicians, in all generations, like Puschnig, Dickbauer, Muthspiel, they all succeed with their art. And that\\'s in part because they really believed in themselves and their creativity. That\\'s really important, otherwise you might have to get a different job.\\nGeorg Vogel & Elias Stemeseder (c) Eckhart Derschmidt\\nWhat are other ingredients to international success? Or what are some barriers?\\nChristoph Huber: From time to time, the musicians are not so interested in leaving their city. And you have to respect that. For example, the famous Hans Koller, the first really international Austrian jazz star. He would have had every possibility to go to the States, for example. He just didn\\'t want to. He played with everyone because they just came through (Europe), like Benny Goodman or Carla Bley. He just said, \\'this is my home, and I don\\'t want to go anywhere else.\\' The problem is, before such musicians might make an international career, they are already teaching the next generation here. Of course, on one hand it gives them security, but on the other, it handicaps you because it lowers your motivation to take certain risks.\\nSo it\\'s the comfort that could kill you? Unlike American artists who, in most cases, have to tour internationally to make a living, European musicians don\\'t have that same pressure.\\nChristoph Huber: Yeah. We are in a welfare state. It\\'s a security blanket, and it\\'s difficult to get people out from under it. I mean, I don\\'t want to lecture anyone, but if you want to conquer the world, you can\\'t wait for the world to come to you.\\nIF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE AS A FRONT-PERSON, YOU CAN\\'T TAKE THE EASY ROUTE\\nStepping out of the box is another ingredient then?\\nChristoph Huber: I\\'d say so. Look at Martin Siewert, a really interesting and accomplished musician. He was the youngest guy at the time to get a Portrait at Porgy. I remember he had recently finished university in Graz but he didn\\'t get a \"sehr gut\" (an \"A\"), but he was one of the most interesting musicians. We decided to give him a Portrait, with 3 nights at Porgy. And he really used that opportunity and invited people like Jamaaladeen Tacuma. He even invested money in it. And, when all is said and done, he found his way, because he did it consistently. Even though it wasn\\'t easy with the kind of art he was interested in.\\nI guess that\\'s another necessity for success? You don\\'t have to please the others and satisfy conventions, but rather stick to your guns and your passions?\\nChristoph Huber: Yes, but it\\'s difficult. In former times, creative musicians, they just skipped the institutions altogether. The famous story with (Joe) Zawinul was he went to the States because he got a scholarship from Berklee, but left almost immediately, saying, \\'Sorry, I can\\'t learn anything here\\'. So he went back to NY, to Birdland and met all those musicians there. And suddenly he had a gig with Maynard Ferguson and then, his career really started. He became the piano player of Cannonball Adderley, which was the hippest band of that time. All that would never have happened without his belief in himself. He said, \\'I am the best, so what can you teach me if I\\'m already the best?\\' It was extraordinary self-confidence. But he\\'s a rare species of course.\\nYou mentioned the Wiesinger sisters; something of a power pair who seem to be popping up all over the place lately.\\nChristoph Huber: Yeah, and rightfully so. They have this great duo together, duo 4675 (that\\'s the zip code of their hometown), as well as an interesting collective called Echoboomer. They\\'re also a regular part of the Orjazztra Vienna, led by Christian Muthspiel.\\nThat collective (Orjazztra Vienna) seems to be something of a hot spot for young talent.\\nChristoph Huber: Absolutely. In there is also the drummer, Judith Schwarz. She\\'s made a strong reputation for herself as an open-minded bandleader and top-notch composer for Little Rosies Kindergarten, for example. Also in her duo with Lisa Hofmaninger (soprano sax and bass clarinet), which is a really interesting combination, as well as in the improvised music context, like with Peter Ponger and Peter Herbert.\\nSo, what is it about these young musicians you\\'ve mentioned, that make them stand out in Austria, and could make them stand out internationally, as well?\\nChristoph Huber: It\\'s a kind of individualism. They have a unique sound, no matter what they do. A personal touch, and an interesting one at that. Another musician, who must be mentioned if we are talking about the \"young lions,\" is Ralph Mothwurf. He leads his own orchestra, among other activities, such as musical director of Yasmo\\'s Klangkantine. All of these musicians are part of a cool generation, who know a lot about music, and had classical education, but are really willing to improvize and take risks. It\\'s not possible to succeed every single time when you have an open concept like theirs. I mean, it can turn out as a highlight, or you know [laughs], you better think it over again. But nevertheless they are willing to take the risk.\\nNo risk… no fun? …no fame?\\nChristoph Huber: Well, if you\\'re not willing to take risks, then you can be a super studio musician, or work as a side-person in a big band, but you won\\'t become one of the big names. For that, you have to take risks, be self-confident, follow your ideas, and be convinced by them, as well as develop them. Georg Vogel is interesting because he\\'s not only a piano player, but a piano constructor. He builds his own instruments. And this idea of 31-tone. It\\'s really spectacular. It\\'s like a philosophical kind of approach. And, that\\'s not nothing. I mean, I don\\'t understand it at all. I have to be honest. [laughs] But I\\'m really interested in it.\\nChristoph Huber: Sometimes it\\'s even difficult to listen to this stuff because at times it just sounds \"wrong\". But I\\'m sure it\\'s not. I know Georg quite well at this point, and I\\'m sure that everything he is doing is on the highest level. So the tones are not wrong. Maybe I just hear them wrong. [laughs] I think from all the young musicians I know, he is maybe the most genius; in many ways, including his way of thinking.\\nWell, you can\\'t top \"genius\" so let\\'s stop the interview here!

Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov\\'s great-grandfather – Yelisey Martynovich – moved to Moscow from the town of Maly Yaroslavets [now Maloyaroslavets]in 1774. His grandfather – Zakhar Yeliseyevich – was a Moscow merchant of the 3rd Guild. In 1828, he opened an establishment in Moscow for dyeing and starching canvas and sailcloth. His father – Mikhail Zakharovich, a Moscow merchant of the 2nd Guild – managed to expand the family business. But the Tretyakovs\\' business did not reach a truly great scale until the next generation. Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov inherited his father\\'s business in the first half of the 1850s. The \\'Brothers P. and S. Tretyakov and V. Konshin\\' trading company appeared in Moscow in 1860. Tretyakov\\'s sons continued trading and industrial business. In 1864, they founded the New Kostroma Linen Mill, built several flax-processing factories in Kostroma, and two years later established the famous Association of the Large Kostroma Linen Mill with a capital of 270,000 gold roubles.\\nIt should be noted that Pavel Mikhailovich spent about 1.5 million roubles on organising an art gallery in Moscow. He received over a third of this amount in the form of profit from the New Kostroma Linen Mill. Thus, the Kostroma textile workers contributed to the creation of a national treasury – the famous Tretyakov Gallery.\\nThe Tretyakov factory was considered one of the most advanced and best equipped in Russia. Pavel Mikhailovich also tried to improve the living conditions of its workers. A school, a hospital, a maternity hospital, a nursing home and a nursery were built for them.\\nExpanding their father\\'s business, the Tretyakov brothers also built cotton factories, which employed about 5,000 people.\\nWhen creating his famous gallery, Pavel Mikhailovich spent enormous amounts of money, perhaps to the detriment of his own family\\'s well-being. And he had a large family. In 1865, Pavel Mikhailovich married Vera Nikolaevna, nee Mamontova, a cousin of Savva Ivanovich Mamontov, a famous Russian entrepreneur, industrialist and philanthropist, the founder of the Moscow Private Opera, and the great-aunt of another Vera Mamontova, who was the model for the painting \\'Girl with Peaches\\' (1887) by V. A. Serov. They had six children – two boys and four girls.\\nS. Turgenev, the composers N. G. Rubinstein and P. I. Tchaikovsky, the artists I. E. Repin, V. I. Surikov, V. D. Polenov, V. M. Vasnetsov, V. G. Perov and I. N. Kramskoy would visit the Tretyakovs. The family was related to some of them: P. I. Tchaikovsky\\'s brother Anatoly was married to Pavel Mikhailovich\\'s niece; the artist V. D. Polenov\\'s wife, N. V. Yakunchikova, was Vera Nikolaevna\\'s niece.\\nPavel Mikhailovich, a fourth-generation merchant, wanted his daughters to marry only merchants. But it so happened that his eldest daughter, Vera, fell in love with the talented pianist Alexander Siloti, the composer S. V. Rachmaninoff\\'s cousin. Knowing that her father might not give her his blessing to marry a musician, Vera was very nervous and even fell ill. When Pavel Mikhailovich saw his daughter\\'s suffering, all his theories regarding his daughters\\' life partners failed.\\nThe painting by Nikolai Ge \\'Peter I Interrogates Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich at Peterhof\\' (1871) was acquired by P. M. Tretyakov in the year it was done\\nThe wedding of Vera Tretyakova and Alexander Siloti took place in February 1887. Alexandra (another daughter) married the doctor and collector Sergey Botkin. His brother Alexander, a doctor, later a hydrographer and an explorer of the North, married Masha. In May 1894, Lyuba married the painter Nikolay Gritsenko. Widowed in 1900, she remarried – her second husband was the famous Leon Bakst, a painter and a designer who created costumes and scenery for Diaghilev\\'s ballet in Paris. Pavel Mikhailovich had enough breadth of vision to appreciate all these young men.\\nThe following fact can testify to the way Tretyakov brought up his daughters. In 1893, Pavel Mikhailovich wrote a very large and serious letter to his daughter Alexandra, in which he explained his idea of parental duties: \\'Money is not a good thing which causes unhealthy relations. Parents must bring up their children and give them education, but they are not at all obliged to provide for them.\\' There were the following words in the same letter: \\'My idea was to make money from a very young age so that what was received from society would also return to society (the people) in some useful institutions; This idea has never left me all my life.\\'\\nFascinated by art, in 1854 Tretyakov began to collect pieces of national Russian works of art. His first acquisitions – about ten graphic sheets of old Dutch painters – were bought at a flea market near the Sukharev Tower. These drawings adorned his living-rooms until his death.\\nAt first lacking experience and multifaceted knowledge in the sphere of art and guided by a deep patriotic feeling, Tretyakov decided to focus on collecting works by contemporary Russian artists. It is known that Pavel Mikhailovich had no special art education. Nevertheless, he bought works by his still little-known yet talented contemporaries. As a rule, he acquired the most significant works from this or that artist.\\n\\'A Clash with Finnish Smugglers\\' (1853) by V. G. Khudyakov was one of the first paintings acquired by Tretyakov in 1856. That year marked the birth of the Tretyakov Gallery. This was followed by the purchase of works by I. P. Trutnev, A. K. Savrasov, K. A. Trutovsky, F. A. Bruni, L. F. Lagorio and others. Knowing about works by K. P. Bryullov in Italy, Tretyakov asked permission from the archaeologist M. Lanci\\'s children to purchase his (Lanci\\'s) portrait. Thus, in 1860, the first work by the \\'great Karl\\' (Bryullov) – \\'Portrait of the Archaeologist M. Lanci\\' (1851) – appeared in the collection. So Tretyakov began selfless collecting work that lasted for many years. It was modest and not designed for advertising and praise. We can say that from the very beginning he had a clear idea of the purpose of his undertaking.\\nPavel Mikhailovich pursued no selfish goals. He came up with the idea of creating a museum of national paintings. In his will, drawn up in 1860, just four years after the purchase of the first paintings, he wrote: \\'For me, who genuinely and ardently loves art, the greatest wish is to lay the foundations for a public repository of fine art, accessible to all, to the benefit of many and pleasure for all.\\'\\nTretyakov\\'s confidence and faith in his cause seem surprising if we remember that he laid the foundations of the gallery at a time when the school of Russian art as an original and significant phenomenon loomed only faintly in the shadow of the great tradition of the West; mighty ancient Russian art had been half-forgotten, works by Russian artists were in private collections in Russia and abroad; when there were still no Repin, no Surikov, no Serov, no Levitan and their paintings, without which it is impossible to imagine Russian art today. It was the time of the formation of democratic art and the birth of a new school of Russian art.\\n\\'…Without his help Russian art would never have entered an open and free phase, since Tretyakov was the only (or almost the only) one who supported everything that was new, fresh and practical in Russian art\\' (A. Benois).\\nThere were few real enthusiasts in old Moscow who took an active part in the lives of young artists. They mostly just bought paintings for their galleries, and sought to pay less for them. Unlike them, Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov was a real patron of arts. His visits to artists were always considered as exciting events, and all of them, masters and beginner artists, with awe waited for his quiet words: \\'I am going to buy your painting,\\' which was tantamount to public recognition for everyone. In 1877, Repin wrote to Tretyakov about his painting \\'Protodeacon\\': \\'I confess to you that if I sell it, then only to you, to your gallery, because, I say without flattery, I consider it a great honour to see my works there.\\' Artists often made concessions to Tretyakov (he never bought paintings without bargaining) and lowered their prices for him, thereby providing all possible support to his undertaking. And the benefits were mutual. Pavel Mikhailovich not only bought paintings, but also ordered them, thus supporting artists both morally and financially, which allowed them not to depend on the tastes of the market.\\nIn the activities of Tretyakov the collector\\'s attention was primarily focused on works by contemporary realist painters of the mid and second half of the nineteenth century – the Wanderers (the Itinerants), representatives of the democratic wing of the national school, which defined the originality of the gallery\\'s collection, the influence of this collection on the development of realist art, and its progressive, revolutionary and educational impact. But in the 1860s, when the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions still did not exist, Tretyakov bought paintings in the official \\'academic\\' style, and from the late 1880s – works by M. V. Nesterov, K. A. Korovin, V. A. Serov and others. Then Tretyakov began to collect drawings, and in the 1890s – icons.\\nTretyakov had unmistakable taste. He was not afraid to buy works by young, still unknown artists. The specifics of the way Pavel Mikhailovich collected paintings are seen in the fact that many works for the gallery were done at his request. And neither then nor today do these works disappoint the most demanding connoisseurs of Russian art with their problems or artistic merits. He bought works even when figures of high authority like L. N. Tolstoy, who did not recognise V. M. Vasnetsov\\'s religious paintings, opposed it. He even bought paintings that were banned by the imperial authorities for public viewing.\\nPavel Mikhailovich acquired paintings at exhibitions and right in the studios of artists. Sometimes he bought entire collections: in 1874 he acquired the Turkestan series by V.V. Vereshchagin (thirteen paintings, 133 drawings and eighty-one sketches), and in 1880 – his Indian series (seventy-eight sketches). There were also over eighty sketches by A. A. Ivanov in Tretyakov\\'s collection. In 1885, Tretyakov bought 102 sketches by V. D. Polenov, done by the artist during a trip to Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Palestine. From V. M. Vasnetsov Pavel Mikhailovich acquired a collection of sketches that he had done while working on murals in St Vladimir\\'s Cathedral in Kiev. V. G. Perov, I. N. Kramskoy, I. E. Repin, V. I. Surikov, I. I. Levitan and V. A. Serov were represented in his collection most fully and by their best works. The gallery was replenished with works by artists of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuries and monuments of ancient Russian art. This heroic period of Russian art can be understood, felt keenly and explored in Moscow, in the Tretyakov Gallery, more than anywhere else.\\nAll artists, young and famous, dreamed of having their paintings hung at the Tretyakov Gallery because the very fact of buying a painting by Pavel Mikhailovich was an act of public recognition of an artist\\'s talent. So one marvellous man managed to influence all Russian pictorial art and become a spokesman for Russian public opinion.\\nTretyakov\\'s great merit is his unshakeable faith in the triumph of the Russian national school of painting – a faith that arose in the late 1850s and was carried by him through his life, through all the trials and tribulations. We can say with confidence that in the late nineteenth century P. M. Tretyakov\\'s personal contribution to the triumph of Russian pictorial art was exceptional and invaluable.\\nEvidence of his ardent faith has been preserved in Pavel Mikhailovich\\'s letters. Here is one of them. In a letter to the artist Rizzoni dated 18 February 1865, he wrote: \\'In the last letter to you my expression might seem incomprehensible: \"Then we would talk with skeptics.\" I will explain: many positively do not want to believe in the good future of Russian art and argue that if some Russian artist sometimes does a good painting, it is allegedly by accident and he will increase the number of mediocrities. I have a different opinion, otherwise I would not have collected Russian paintings; but sometimes I could not but agree with the facts presented; and every success, every step forward is very dear to me, and I will be very happy if I live to see when our day comes.\\' And about a month later, returning to the same thought, Tretyakov wrote: \\'I involuntarily believe in my hope: our Russian school will not be the worst – it was indeed a clouded time, and for quite a long time, but now the fog is lifting.\\'\\nHis faith was not a blind intuitive feeling: it was based on careful observation of the development of Russian pictorial art, on a deep, subtle understanding of national ideals that were being formed on a democratic basis.\\nP. M. Tretyakov acquired the painting \\'Horsewoman\\' (1832) by Karl Bryullov in 1893\\nSo, back in 1857, Pavel Mikhailovich wrote to the landscape painter A. G. Goravsky: \\'Concerning my landscape, I humbly ask you to leave it, and instead paint me a new one someday. I need neither rich nature, nor a great composition, nor spectacular light, nor miracles.\\' Instead, Tretyakov asked him to depict simple nature, even if unprepossessing, \\'but there must be truth and poetry in it. And poetry can be in everything – this is the artist\\'s work.\\'\\nThis note expresses the very aesthetic principle of the formation of the gallery, which emerged as a result of reflecting on the development of Russian national pictorial art. P. M. Tretyakov had guessed its progressive tendencies long before the appearance of Savrasov\\'s painting \\'The Rooks Have Come Back\\', the landscapes by Vasiliev, Levitan, Serov, Ostroukhov and Nesterov – the artists who managed to create a truthful depiction of Russian nature, conveying the poetry and charm inherent in it.\\nPavel Mikhailovich first entrusted the idea of creating a national or folk art gallery to the artist V. G. Khudyakov and outlined it with the utmost accuracy in a testament written in Warsaw on 17 (29) May, 1860, during his first trip abroad.\\nHis relatives did not have to execute this will. Pavel Mikhailovich himself fulfilled his dream – he set up a folk-art gallery.\\nInteresting statements by P. M. Tretyakov can also be found in his correspondence with Vereshchagin regarding the depiction of the contemporary Russo-Turkish war of 1877–1878 for the liberation of Bulgaria – a war in which Russia took Bulgaria\\'s side. On learning that Vereshchagin was going to the front to do a series of paintings about the war, Tretyakov wrote to the critic of music and art V.V. Stasov: \\'Perhaps only in the distant future will the sacrifice made by the Russian people be appreciated.\\'\\nTretyakov suggested that Vereshchagin pay a large sum in advance for his work: \\'However strange acquiring a collection without knowing its contents may be, Vereshchagin is a kind of artist you can rely on, especially since giving paintings over to private hands, he will not be bound by choosing subjects and, probably, will be imbued with the spirit of the sacrifice of people and the brilliant heroic deeds of Russian soldiers and some individuals.\\'\\nVereshchagin had a different opinion: \\'As for your letter to V.V. Stasov on my painting you saw, you and I obviously disagree a little in the assessment of my works and a lot in their trends. There is war before me as before an artist, and I strike at it with all my might; whether my blows are strong or real – this is a question of my talent, but I fight with all my strength and mercilessly…\\'\\nIn addition to collecting, Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov was actively involved in charity work. He was an honorary member of the Russian Society of Art Lovers and the Russian Musical Society from the day they were founded and contributed substantial sums, supporting all educational initiatives. He provided material assistance to individual artists and the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture; from 1869 he was a member of the Council of the Moscow Trust for the Poor. He was also a member of the councils of the Moscow Commercial College and the Alexander Commercial College. Pavel Mikhailovich bequeathed half of his funds to charitable purposes: to set up a shelter for widows, young children and unmarried daughters of deceased artists (it was built in 1909–1912 by the architect N. S. Kurdyukov in Lavrushinsky Lane); for distribution among workers and employees of his enterprises; and for funding the gallery. He gave donations to help the families of soldiers who had fallen in the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish (1877-1878) War. P. M. Tretyakov scholarships were established at the Moscow Commercial College and the Alexander Commercial College.\\nPavel Mikhailovich never refused to render financial aid to artists and other applicants. He took good care of the money affairs of painters who entrusted their savings to him with confidence. He repeatedly lent money to his good adviser I. N. Kramskoy, selflessly helped V. G. Khudyakov, K. A. Trutovsky, M. K. Klodt and many others.\\nBrothers Pavel and Sergey Tretyakov founded the Arnold-Tretyakov Deaf-and-Dumb School in Moscow. Pavel Mikhailovich took his establishment very seriously. At first classes with deaf-mute children in live speech were rather primitive, and Pavel Mikhailovich sent the headmaster D.K. Organov abroad at his own expense so he could familiarize himself with the teaching process in similar schools. In addition to general subjects, children were taught crafts. The school, or the \\'institution for the deaf-mute\\', obtained a large stone house with a huge garden, where 156 pupils of both sexes studied and lived, and in the early 1890s Pavel Mikhailovich built a hospital with thirty-three beds at his own expense.\\nPatronage of the school, which began in the 1860s, continued throughout Pavel Mikhailovich\\'s life and after his death. In his will Pavel Mikhailovich left very generous funds for the school for the deaf and dumb. Boys and girls would be brought up till the age of sixteen and receive a profession. Tretyakov selected the best teachers, got acquainted with the teaching methods, and made sure that the pupils were well fed and clothed. On each visit to the school he went round the classes and workshops during class hours and was always present at exams.\\nIn 1871, on the initiative of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov, a passage was built between Nikolskaya Street and Teatralny Passage on the site of an earlier one that had been built up in the eighteenth century. In 1870–1871 the architect A. S. Kaminsky constructed two buildings with passage arches facing Nikolskaya Street and Teatralny Passage on the site purchased by the Tretyakovs especially for the arrangement of the passage; the facade of the building from the side of Teatralny Passage was built into the Kitay-Gorod Wall next to the tower (1534–1538) and designed in a romantic-medieval style. There were shops inside the passage. Such urban planning solution is unique for Moscow. The new structure was called Tretyakov Drive.\\nThe Explanatory Dictionary defines charity as \\'gratuitous actions and deeds whose aim is the public good.\\' With reference to the life of Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov we can add: \\'and which will never be forgotten.\\'\\nПредыдущая статьяProblems to be solved\\nСледующая статья Patrons of Imperial Russia\\nProblems to be solved<|begin_of_text|>Brexit means Brexit – and it hurts!\\nTOPICS:EconomicsEuropean UnionPoliticsRitchie\\nPolitics of peace: sharing sovereignty and spreading prosperity makes impossible the settling of differences by war.\\nBritish negotiators in Brussels are missing the point and will never win a good deal.

Because the European Union is more about politics than economics, writes Murray Ritchie.\\nMany years ago in Brussels when Jacques Delors was president of the European Commission he shook his head in sadness at the latest fusillade of Eurosceptic hostility from across the Channel. This was during the tensions created by the proposed single currency and Britain\\'s opposition to it.\\n\"The British are an island people,\" he concluded with a Gallic shrug. As if that explained everything – and in a way it did exactly that.

We have managed to hurt our European partners, not just for causing a potential economic schism, but for rejecting the European Union\\'s (EU) overriding aspiration – peace and prosperity in ever-closer union.\\nTo Europhile eyes the EU represents an ideal that the UK has betrayed. Ever-closer union, to which we signed up over a series of treaties, was fine until Delors, Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand got serious about integration.\\n\\'We must build a kind of United States of Europe. In this way only will hundreds of millions of toilers be able to regain the simple joys and hopes which make life worth living.\\'\\nThis was where the normal relationship between politics and economics was turned on its head.

Messrs Delors, Kohl and Mitterrand, integrationists all, were not about to let themselves be embarrassed.\\nRemember how Kohl ordered the exchange rate for the worthless East German Ostmark to be one-for-one with the Deutschmark despite the obvious economic madness?

(More headshaking from M Delors.) But that was then. We were content to grumble on the sidelines while drawing a line at further integration.\\nThat foot-dragging has now brought us to the crunch where political determination confronts economic challenge. Britain is desperate for a trade deal to equal and replicate the single market and/or the customs union. But EU politics insists there is no chance of that in practical terms otherwise what is the point of membership?\\nPolitics will win if we go by precedent.

Politics and economics – the twin basis of today\\'s EU since its inception 70 years ago – go hand in hand, but the politics still drives the economics, not the other way round.\\nBritain has offended this ideal – although 48 per cent of us are blameless – and we are probably about to pay an enormous price.\\nIronically, when we become isolated we are likely to be in the dangerous position of allowing economic desperation to reverse the process.\\nWhen you allow dire economic misery to drive politics – inter-war Germany comes to mind – the future can be terrifying.

Trained as a philosopher, self-educated as a political economist, and an organizer of the International Workingmen\\'s Association, Marx became interested in social change during his university studies. Upon receiving his doctorate in absentia from the University of Jena in 1841, Marx was hired as editor of the Rheinische Zeitung, a German newspaper. There he championed the rights of peasants against the Prussian government in an editorial column. This led to his opponents accusing Marx of being a \"communist\" and to his being ostracized. Marx left for Paris where he continued to suffer accusation from the Prussian and the French governments.\\nMarx developed his revolutionary theories over a period of four decades beginning in 1843. He formulated his theories with the intention to liberate wage workers or laborers from the capitalist societies of nineteenth century Europe. He maintained that in order to emancipate humanity from economic domination, a social revolution was needed. The envisioned result would transform the existing economic structures, and create a society in which property, particularly the means of production would no longer be held privately. Marx\\'s theories were developed in close collaboration with Friedrich Engels. Together they included an explanation of human alienation and dialectical materialism. Marx and Engels\\' vision was a purely materialist interpretation of human nature and development within nature that called for revolution. It represented a materialist view of history, based on the dialectic, that supported Marx\\'s theory of political economy and his call for revolution. The interpretation distinguished itself because of its theory of surplus value, which asserted that the wealth of capitalist societies originates solely from the exploitation of laborers.\\nMarx\\'s analysis of history saw human development as occurring due to a series of class struggles between the ruling class, those who possess the means of production. To Marx, feudal lords, land owners and capitalists were pitted against the ruled working class. This claim is summed up in the opening line of The Communist Manifesto: \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle.\" Marx predicted the demise of capitalism through a workers\\' revolution that would lead to a utopian \"classless society\" where, according to Marx, \"people work according to their ability and get according to their needs\" and \"in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\"\\n1.1 Parents\\n1.2 Education\\n1.3 Career\\n1.4 Family life\\n1.5 Later life\\n1.6 Influences on Marx\\'s thought\\n1.7 Marx\\'s View of History\\n1.8 Critique of capitalism\\n2 Marx\\'s influence\\n5.1 Bibliography and online texts\\n5.2 Biographies\\n5.3 Portraits\\n5.4 Encyclopedia entries\\nHis vision and ideals inspired Vladimir Lenin. Lenin embraced Marx\\'s vision, but made certain adjustments in Marxist theories and practice and orchestrated the first communist revolution. Marxism, as understood and implemented by Lenin resulted in totalitarian control. Lenin\\'s interpretation of Marxism is usually referred to as Marxism-Leninism. Some argue that Lenin\\'s views were inconsistent with Marx\\'s view, however this is subject to debate. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, the largest of all twentieth century socialist empires in 1991, was preceded by the breakdown of Marxist regimes throughout Eastern Europe. This breakdown has been followed by radical reforms in other communist countries including China, Mongolia and Vietnam. The failure of Marxism or Marxism-Leninism was not primarily due to its misapplication by Lenin, Josef Stalin or others. It stemmed from the philosophical and scientific underpinnings of Marxism, including its militant atheism, its commitment to revolutionary violence, and its flawed economic theories.\\nKarl Heinrich Marx was the third of seven children in a Jewish family in Trier, Province of the Lower Rhine, in the Kingdom of Prussia. His father, Heinrich Marx (1777–1838), descended from a line of rabbis, converted to Christianity, despite a deistic tendency and admiration of Enlightenment intellectuals such as Voltaire and Rousseau. Heinrich Marx was born Herschel Mordechai, son of Levy Mordechai (1743-1804) and wife Eva Lwow (1753-1823), but when the Christian Prussian authorities disallowed his law practice as a Jew, he converted to Lutheranism, the Prussian State\\'s official Protestant religion, to gain advantage as member of the Lutheran minority in that predominantly Roman Catholic state. His mother was Henriette née Pressburg (1788–1863), also from a well connected family.\\nMarx\\'s mother converted back to Judaism immediately after the death of her husband in 1835 and Marx clearly suffered some rejection in Prussian society because of his ethnic origins. This is most clearly seen in the fact that Marx\\'s was so secretive in the courting of his future bride, Jenny von Westphalen.\\nThe adolescent Karl Marx.\\nKarl Marx was home-schooled until the age of 13 when he entered Trier Gymnasium. Just before he left Marx wrote an essay, The Union of Believers With Christ, which showed him to be a person with a deep and sensitive faith in God.[1] He then enrolled, at age 17, to study law at the University of Bonn. Despite wanting to study philosophy and literature, his father disallowed it, believing Karl would be unable to support himself as a scholar. He joined the Trier Tavern Club and at one point served as its president but his grades suffered as a result. The next year, his father had him transfer to the rigorous Humboldt-Universität in Berlin. At that time, Marx wrote poems about life which Richard Wurmbrand suggested reveal him going through a spiritual crisis.[2] An example of this is a verse from his play Oulanem[3]\\nHellish evaporations rise and fill my brains,\\nUntil I will go mad and my heart will not change dramatically.\\nSee this sword?\\nThe King of darkness\\nsold it to me.\\nIn a letter to his father, Marx describes the inner struggles he went through and why his interests turned to philosophy[4] He joined the circle of students and young professors known as the \"Young Hegelians\", student philosophers and journalists orbiting Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, in opposition to G.W.F. Hegel, their teacher. For many of them, the so-called left-Hegelians, Hegel\\'s dialectical method, separated from its theological content, provided a powerful weapon for the critique of established religion and politics. Some members of this circle drew an analogy between post-Aristotelian philosophy and post-Hegelian philosophy. Another Young Hegelian, Max Stirner, applied Hegelian criticism and argued that stopping anywhere short of nihilistic egoism was mysticism. His views were not accepted by most of his colleagues; nevertheless, Stirner\\'s book was the main reason Marx abandoned the Feuerbachian view and developed the basic concept of historical materialism.\\nIn 1841, Marx earned a doctorate with the dissertation The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature, but submitted it to the University of Jena, because his bad reputation as a Young Hegelian radical would hurt him in Berlin.\\nWhen his mentor, Bruno Bauer, was dismissed from Friedrich-Wilhelms\\' philosophy faculty in 1842, Marx abandoned philosophy for journalism and in 1842 was chosen to edit the Rheinische Zeitung, a radical Cologne newspaper. After the newspaper was shut down in 1843, to a large extent, due to Marx\\'s conflicts with government censors, Marx returned to philosophy, turned to political activism, and made his living as a freelance journalist. Marx was soon forced into exile, something he would do often as a result of his views.\\nThe Communist Manifesto which was distributed in Germany during the revolution of 1848\\nMarx first moved to Paris, where he re-evaluated his relationship with Bauer and the Young Hegelians, and wrote his Paris Manuscripts which serve as the fundamental underpinnings of the Communist Manifesto. In those manuscripts, Marx rejects the notion that the Prussian government, through its bureaucracy of civil servants, can serve as the vehicle for genuine social change. He also identified the proletariat rather than the Prussian civil servants as the vehicle through which change could occur. He saw that change as being effected through a social revolution. It was in Paris that he met and began working with his lifelong close friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels, a committed communist, who kindled Marx\\'s interest in the situation of the working class and guided Marx\\'s interest in economics. After he was forced to leave Paris because of his writings, Marx and Engels moved to Brussels, Belgium.\\nThere they co-wrote The German Ideology, a scathing criticism of the philosophy of Bruno Bauer, Hegel, and the Young Hegelians. Marx next wrote The Poverty of Philosophy (1847), a critique of French socialist thought. These works laid the foundation for Marx and Engels\\' most famous work, The Communist Manifesto, first published on February 21, 1848. It had been commissioned by the Communist League (formerly, the League of the Just), an organization of German émigrés whom Marx had converted in London.\\nThat year Europe experienced revolutionary upheaval; a working-class movement seized power from King Louis Philippe in France and invited Marx to return to Paris. When this government collapsed in 1849, Marx moved back to Cologne and restarted the Rheinische Zeitung, only to be swiftly expelled again.\\nIn 1864, Marx organized the International Workingmen\\'s Association, later called the First International, as a base for continued political activism. In his inaugural address, he purported to quote Gladstone\\'s speech, to the effect that, \"This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property.\" He repeated the citation in volume 1 of Capital. The discrepancy between Marx\\'s quote and the Hansard version of the speech (which was well-known) was soon employed in an attempt to discredit the International. Marx attempted to rebut the accusations of dishonesty, but the allegation continued to resurface. Marx later gave as his source the newspaper the Morning Star.\\nEngels devoted a good deal of attention to the affair in the preface to the fourth edition of Capital—which still did not put the matter to rest. Engels claimed that it was not the Morning Star but the Times that Marx was following. Indeed, modern critics of Marx continue to invoke Marx\\'s supposed misquotation as evidence of general dishonesty.\\nKarl Marx married Jenny von Westphalen, the educated daughter of a Prussian baron. Their seven year long engagement was kept secret, for being opposed by both families; they married on 19 June, 1843, in the Kreuznacher Pauluskirche, Bad Kreuznach.\\nThe Marxes were poor in the first half of the 1850s, living in a three-room flat in Dean Street, Soho, London. Already, they had four children; three more followed; in all, only three saw adulthood. His principal source of income was Engels\\'s subsidy, and income from weekly newspaper articles written as a New York Daily Tribune foreign correspondent. Inheritances from an uncle of Jenny, and her mother, who died in 1856, permitted the Marx family to move to healthier lodgings in Kentish Town, a new, London suburb. Despite the family\\'s hand-to-mouth life, Marx provided his wife and children with the necessary bourgeois luxuries requisite to their social status and contemporary mores.\\nMarx\\'s children with wife Jenny were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy (\"Guido\"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances (\"Franziska\"; 1851–1852); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855–1898); and several who died before naming (July 1857). Marx may have also fathered Frederick Demuth by his housekeeper, Lenchen Demuth. This is disputed and not corroborated.[5] Their daughter Eleanor Marx (1855 – 1898), who was born in London, was a committed socialist who helped edit her father\\'s works until she committed suicide.\\nKarl Marx Tomb in London\\nFrom 1850 to 1864, Marx lived in poverty only taking a job once. He and his family were evicted from their apartment and several of his children died, his son, Guido, who Marx called \"a sacrifice to bourgeois misery\" and a daughter named Franziska. They were so poor that his wife had to borrow money for her coffin.\\nFrederich Engels was the one who gave Marx and his family money to survive on during these years. His only other source of money was his job as the European correspondent for The New York Tribune, writing editorials and columns analyzing everything in the \"political universe.\"\\nMarx was generally impoverished during the later period of his life, depending on financial contributions from close friend and fellow author, Friedrich Engels, to help with his family\\'s living expenses and debts. Following the death of his wife Jenny in 1881, Marx died in London in 1883, and is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London. The message carved on Marx\\'s tombstone—a monument built in 1954 by the Communist Party of Great Britain—is: \"Workers of the world, unite!\" Marx\\'s original tomb was humbly adorned.\\nInfluences on Marx\\'s thought\\nMarx\\'s thought was strongly influenced by:\\nThe dialectical historicism of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel;\\nThe humanism of Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach\\nThe classical political economy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo; and\\nThe French socialist and communist thought of Saint-Simon and Fourier.\\nMarx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. However, Marx was not only interested in studying history and social development. He famously asserted that \"philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it,\" and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.\\nMarx\\'s view of history, which came to be called the materialist interpretation of history (and which was developed further as the philosophy of dialectical materialism) is certainly influenced by Hegel\\'s claim that reality (and history) should be viewed dialectically, through a clash of opposing forces. Hegel believed that the direction of human history is characterized in the movement from the fragmentary toward the complete and the real (which was also a movement towards greater and greater rationality). Sometimes, Hegel explained, this progressive unfolding of the Absolute involves gradual, evolutionary accretion but at other times requires discontinuous, revolutionary leaps—episodal upheavals against the existing status quo. For example, Hegel strongly opposed the ancient institution of legal slavery that was practiced in the United States during his lifetime, and he envisioned a time when Christian nations would radically eliminate it from their civilization. While Marx accepted this broad conception of history, Hegel was an idealist, and Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms. He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that it was necessary to set it upon its feet. (Hegel\\'s philosophy remained and remains in direct opposition to Marxism on this key point.)\\nMarx\\'s acceptance of this notion of materialist dialectics that rejected Hegel\\'s idealism was greatly influenced by his study of Ludwig Feuerbach. In The Essence of Christianity, Feuerbach argued that God is really a creation of man and that the qualities people attribute to God are really qualities of humanity. For example, the Holy Trinity was a human projection of the family (man, woman, and child) onto God. Accordingly, Marx argued that it is the material world that is real and that our ideas of it are consequences, not causes, of the world. Thus, like Hegel and other philosophers, Marx distinguished between appearances and reality. But he did not believe that the material world hides from us the \"real\" world of the ideal; on the contrary, he thought that historically and socially specific ideologies prevented people from seeing the material conditions of their lives clearly.\\nMarx\\'s View of History\\nAccording to Marx, the development of history is caused by the contradiction between the productive forces and the production relations of society. By \"productive forces, \"Marx is referring to the means of production and to the level of human technical understanding. By production relations, Marx is referring to class relations.\\nAt a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production. From forms of development of the productive forces, these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an epoch of social revolution (Marx and Engels, Selected Works, p. 182).\\nThe notion of labor is fundamental in Marx\\'s thought. Basically, Marx argued that it is human nature to transform nature, and he calls this process of transformation \"labor\" and the capacity to transform nature labor \"power.\" For Marx, this is a natural capacity for a physical activity, but it is intimately tied to the human mind and human imagination:\\nA spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality (Capital, vol. 1, chap. 7, pt. 1).\\nAlong with the Hegelian dialectic, Marx inherited a disdain for the notion of an underlying invariant human nature. Sometimes Marxists express their views by contrasting \"nature\" with \"history.\" Sometimes they use the phrase \"existence precedes consciousness.\" The point, in either case, is that who a person is, is determined by where and when he is—the social context takes precedence over innate behavior; or, in other words, one of the main features of human nature is adaptability.\\nMarx did not believe that all people worked the same way, or that how one works is entirely personal and individual. Instead, he argued that work is a social activity and that the conditions and forms under and through which people work are socially determined and change over time.\\nMarx\\'s analysis of history is based on his distinction between the means of production, literally those things, such as land, natural resources, and technology and know-how, that are necessary for the production of material goods, and the relations of production, in other words, the social and technical relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these comprise the mode of production. Marx observed that within any given society the mode of production changes and that European societies had progressed from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist mode of production. In general, Marx believed that the means of production change more rapidly than production relations (for example, a new technology develops, such as the Internet, and only later are the laws developed to regulate the new technology). For Marx, this mismatch between (economic) base and social superstructure is a major source of social disruption and conflict.\\nMarx understood the \"social relations of production\" to comprise not only relations among individuals, but between or among groups of people, or social classes. As a materialist, Marx did not understand classes as purely subjective (in other words, groups of people who consciously identified with one another). He sought to define classes in terms of objective criteria, such as their access to resources. For Marx, different classes have divergent interests, which is another source of social disruption and conflict.\\nMarx was especially concerned with how people relate to that most fundamental resource of all, their own labor power. Marx wrote extensively about this in his theory of alienation. Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one\\'s own labor—one\\'s capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one\\'s own nature; it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss in terms of commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behavior merely adapt. This disguises the fact that the exchange and circulation of commodities really are the product and reflection of social relationships among people. Under capitalism, social relationships of production, such as among workers or between workers and capitalists, are mediated through commodities, including labor, which are bought and sold on the market.\\nCommodity fetishism is an example of what Engels called false consciousness, which is closely related to the understanding of ideology. By \"ideology\" Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which are presented as universal and eternal. Marx and Engels\\' point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths; they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods; it includes the production of ideas as well (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests). Thus, while such ideas may be false, they also reveal in coded form some truth about political relations. According to Marx and Engels, people under capitalism are alienated from their own labor power. one example of this sort of analysis is found in Marx\\'s understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the Philosophy of Right:\\nReligious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\\nWhereas his gymnasium senior thesis argued that the primary social function of religion was to promote solidarity, here Marx sees the social function as a way of expressing and coping with social inequality, thereby maintaining the status quo.\\nCritique of capitalism\\nMarx argued that this alienation of human work (and resulting commodity fetishism) is the defining feature of capitalism. Prior to capitalism, markets existed in Europe where producers and merchants bought and sold commodities. According to Marx, a capitalist mode of production developed in Europe when labor itself became a commodity—when peasants became free to sell their own labor power, and needed to do so because they no longer possessed their own land or the tools necessary to produce a living. People sell their labor power when they accept compensation in return for whatever work they do in a given period of time (in other words, they are not selling the product of their labor, but their capacity to work). In return for selling their labor power they receive money, which allows them to survive. Those who must sell their labor power to live are \"proletarians.\" The person who buys the labor power, generally someone who does own the land and technology to produce, is a \"capitalist\" or \"bourgeoisie.\" (Marx considered this an objective description of capitalism, distinct from any one of a variety of ideological claims of or about capitalism.) The proletarians inevitably outnumber the capitalists.\\nMarx distinguished industrial capitalists from merchant capitalists. Merchants buy goods in one place and sell them in another; more precisely, they buy things in one market and sell them in another. Since the laws of supply and demand operate within given markets, there is often a difference between the price of a commodity in one market and another. Merchants, then, practice arbitrage, and hope to capture the difference between these two markets. According to Marx, industrial capitalists, on the other hand, take advantage of the difference between the labor market and the market for whatever commodity is produced. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit costs are lower than output unit prices. Marx called the difference \"surplus value\" and argued that this surplus value had its source in the exploitation of laborers, i.e., through paying them \"survival wages\" rather than what they were entitled to receive.\\nThe capitalist mode of production is capable of tremendous growth because the capitalist can, and has an incentive to, reinvest profits in new technologies. Marx considered the capitalist class to be the most revolutionary in history, because it constantly revolutionized the means of production. But Marx argued that capitalism was prone to periodic crises. He suggested that over time, capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies, and less and less in labor. Since Marx believed that surplus value appropriated from labor is the source of profits, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall even as the economy grew. When the rate of profit falls below a certain point, the result would be a recession or depression in which certain sectors of the economy would collapse. Marx believed that during such a crisis the price of labor would also fall, and eventually make possible the investment in new technologies and the growth of new sectors of the economy.\\nMarx believed that this cycle of growth, collapse, and growth would be punctuated by increasingly severe crises. Moreover, he believed that the long-term consequence of this process was necessarily the enrichment and empowerment of the capitalist class and the impoverishment of the proletariat. He argued that if the proletariat would seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, and a system of production less vulnerable to periodic crises. In general, Marx thought that peaceful negotiation of this problem was impracticable, and that a massive, well-organized, and violent revolution would in general be required, because the ruling class would not give up power without violence. He theorized that to establish the socialist system, a dictatorship of the proletariat—a period where the needs of the working-class, not of capital, will be the common deciding factor—must be created on a temporary basis. As he wrote in his Critique of the Gotha Program, \"between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat\" [1].\\nMarx saw evil originating in in social relations, or social structure, rather than in human beings. As such, he failed to foresee the selfishness of those in the working class, who after seizing \"the means of production\" would develop a totalitarian system.\\nMarx\\'s influence\\nStatue of Marx and Engels in Alexanderplatz, Berlin. The statues acquired the unofficial nickname \"the Pensioners,\" and were also said to be sitting on their suitcases waiting for permission to emigrate to the West.\\nMarx and Engels\\' work covers a wide range of topics and presents a complex analysis of history and society in terms of class relations. Followers of Marx and Engels have drawn on this work to propose a political and economic philosophy dubbed Marxism. Nevertheless, there have been numerous debates among Marxists over how to interpret Marx\\'s writings and how to apply his concepts to current events and conditions (and it is important to distinguish between \"Marxism\" and \"what Marx believed.\" Essentially, people use the word \"Marxist\" to describe those who rely on Marx\\'s conceptual language (e.g. means of production, class, commodity) to understand capitalist and other societies, or to describe those who believe that a workers\\' revolution is the only means to a communist society. Marxism has influenced Christian thought, too, especially liberation theology, which argues in favor of God\\'s special concern for, or bias towards, the poor and advocates that when the poor become conscious of their exploitation, they will then be empowered to demand and achieve their rights. Liberation theologians do not necessarily support violence as part of this process, although many have.\\nSix years after Marx\\'s death, Engels and others founded the \"Second International\" as a base for continued political activism. This organization collapsed in 1914, in part because some members turned to Edward Bernstein\\'s \"evolutionary\" socialism, and in part because of divisions precipitated by World War I.\\nWorld War I also led to the Russian Revolution and the consequent ascendance of Vladimir Lenin\\'s leadership of the communist movement, embodied in the \"Comintern\" or \"Third International.\" Lenin claimed to be both the philosophical and political heir to Marx, and developed a political program, called Leninism or Bolshevism, which called for revolution organized and led by a centrally organized Communist party.\\nAfter Lenin\\'s death, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, seized control of the Party and state apparatus. He argued that before a worldwide communist revolution would be possible, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had to dedicate itself to building communism in its own country. People who have not seriously studied Lenin\\'s writings and the brutality of his rule argue that it was Stalin\\'s Soviet Union and its policies that undermined the concept of Marxism in the Western world. However, the collapse of communism stemmed from its underpinnings as well as from its application beginning with Lenin. For many years, especially after the Second World War during the Cold War period, Marxism was popularly equated with Stalin\\'s communism, which was a totalitarianism that disregarded civil rights.\\nStatue of Marx and Engels in Budapest.\\nIn 1929, Leon Trotsky was expelled from the Soviet Union and in 1938 founded the competing \"Fourth International.\" Some followers of Trotsky argued that Stalin had created a bureaucratic state rather than a socialist state.\\nIn China, Mao Zedong also claimed to be an heir to Marx, but argued that peasants and not just workers could play a leading role in a communist revolution. This resonated with Lenin\\'s views in What is to be done? and in the strategy of the Bolshevik revolution which reached out to three constituencies: Laborers, Peasants, and Soldiers, promising the laborers \"bread,\" the peasants \"land,\" and the soldiers \"peace.\" This was a departure from Marx\\'s own view of revolution, which focused exclusively on the urban proletariat. Marx believed revolution would take place in advanced industrial societies such as France, Germany, and England.\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, a group of dissident Marxists founded the Institute for Social Research in Germany, among them Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse. As a group, these authors are often called the Frankfurt School. Their work is known as critical theory, indebted to Marxist philosophy and the cultural criticism heavily influenced by Hegel, Freud, Nietzsche, and Max Weber.\\nThe Frankfurt School broke with earlier Marxists, including Lenin and Bolshevism in several key ways. First, because of Stalinism and fascism, they had grave doubts about the traditional Marxist concept of proletarian class consciousness. Second, unlike earlier Marxists, especially Lenin, they rejected economic determinism. While highly influential, their work has been criticized by Marxists for divorcing Marxist theory from practical struggle and turning Marxism into a purely academic enterprise.\\nOther influential non-Bolshevik Marxists at that time include Georg Lukacs, Walter Benjamin, and Antonio Gramsci, who along with the Frankfurt School are often known by the term \"Western Marxism.\" Henryk Grossman, who elaborated the mathematical basis of Marx\\'s \"law of capitalist breakdown,\" was another affiliate of the Frankfurt School. Also prominent during this period was the Polish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg.\\nIn 1949, Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman founded Monthly Review, a journal and press, to provide an outlet for Marxist thought in the United States independent of the Communist Party of the United States of America.\\nIn 1978, G. A. Cohen attempted to defend Marx\\'s thought as a coherent and scientific theory of history by reconstructing it through the lens of analytic philosophy. This gave birth to \"Analytical Marxism,\" an academic movement which included Jon Elster, Adam Przeworski, and John Roemer.\\n↑ http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1837-pre/marx/1835chris.htm.

Could an arms race ensue?\\nBy Mike Yeo for The Diplomat\\nCredit: REUTERS/U.S. Navy/Adam K. Thomas\\nThe Pacific region—for this article, the line of nations bordering the Pacific Ocean stretching from Australia to Japan and the Korean Peninsula—has in the past decade or so witnessed a surge in the number of naval ships sporting a \"through deck\" design to allow flight operations to be conducted from their flight decks. Usually classified as amphibious ships or helicopter destroyers/cruisers, they had mostly escaped serious scrutiny in the mainstream consciousness. Until the past few weeks, that is, when a series of events thrust these vessels into global news headlines.\\nExcluding the United States\\' two forward-deployed flattops—the USS George Washington and the USS Bonhomme Richard—in Japan, there are now at least eleven such ships planned, being built or in service among the Asia-Pacific\\'s navies as of today. These ships are officially described as being designed for amphibious operations, while their ability to operate helicopters will also be useful in anti-submarine warfare and to provide aid in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations. Still, most are a refit away from (or in China\\'s case, already capable of) operating fixed-wing aircraft, sparking fears of an arms race against the backdrop of simmering territorial disputes in the region.\\nAustralia is currently building two 27,800-ton Canberra-class Landing Helicopter Docks (LHDs) under Joint Project 2048. The ships, HMAS Canberra (LHD-02) and HMAS Adelaide (LHD-01) are based on the Spanish Navy\\'s Juan Carlos I built by Spain\\'s Navantia. The design was the winner of a competition with France\\'s Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN), which offered a larger version of the Mistral class design.\\nThe HMAS Canberra is currently being completed at BAE Systems – Maritime in Melburne after having been initially laid down in Spain and transported by sea to Australia. She will enter service with the Royal Australian Navy in 2014 while her sister ship will join her two years later. The LHDs will replace the HMAS Tobruk and the Kanimbla-class ships in mainly conducting amphibious operations with a secondary HADR brief.\\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\\nThe Canberra class vessels boast a length of 230.82 metres (757.3 ft), with a maximum beam of 32 metres (105 ft) and maximum draught of 7.08 metres (23.2 ft). Maximum speed is 20 knots, and the LHDs will sport four Rafael Typhoon 25 mm remote weapons systems, six 12.7 mm machine guns, an AN/SLQ-25 Nixie towed torpedo decoy, and a Nulka missile decoy.\\nThe LHDs will be able to carry 1,046 soldiers and their equipment. Two vehicle decks (one for light vehicles, the other for heavy vehicles and tanks) can accommodate up to 110 vehicles. Each ship has a well deck for landing craft, while the flight deck has landing spots for six NH90-class helicopters or four CH-47 Chinook-class helicopters to operate simultaneously. The ships are equipped with a 13° ski jump retained from the Juan Carlos I design, although Australia has no plans to operate fixed-wing aircraft from these ships. The standard air group will typically be a mix of MRH-90 transport helicopters and S-70B Seahawk anti-submarine helicopters. The hangar can accommodate up to 18 helicopters, but eight will be the standard complement.\\nChina is unique in the operators of flight decks in the region in that it is the only regional country to currently operate fixed-wing aircraft from its carriers. The People\\'s Liberation Army – Navy (PLAN) is currently operating the Liaoning, originally destined to be a Admiral Kuznetsov-class multirole aircraft carrier for the Soviet Navy. After an epic history—at one point, it was supposed to become a floating casino—the ship put to sea on August 10, 2011 for the first of several sea trials. The Liaoning is currently based at Qingdao, home of the PLAN\\'s North Sea fleet, where it operates as a training ship.\\nIt is still unclear what Liaoning\\'s air wing will look like, but a clue may lie in the 30-strong complement of the Kuznetsov\\xad-class. The Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark, a Chinese-built navalized derivative of the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker, has been seen operating on board during the numerous sea trials. As the Liaoning utilizes the STOBAR (Short Take Off Barrier Recovery) method of operating aircraft, heavier aircraft like the JZY-01 carrier-borne AEW under development will not be able to operate from the ship. J-15 operations on board the Liaoning will also be curtailed by fuel and payload limitations due to the ship\\'s STOBAR configuration. Rotary-wing assets include the Changhe Z-8, which also has an AEW variant, and possibly the Kamov Ka-27 Helix.\\nIt was already widely expected that China will be building more carriers after the Liaoning. In late July 2013, photos surfaced of a module of what appears to be an aircraft carrier under construction. The existence of a trench near an edge of the module fuelled speculation that this carrier will be equipped with a CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) system, which China is very keen on developing for its future carrier fleet. However, another image of the Liaoning on a visit to Dalian on further sea trials appears to show a carrier\\'s bow section being built in the background. Interestingly, this looks to be another STOBAR design, with the gradient for a ski jump being quite obvious despite the module being in the shadows.\\nDiplomat Brief\\nGet first-read access to major articles yet to be released, as well as links to thought-provoking commentaries and in-depth articles from our Asia-Pacific correspondents.\\nIn the absence of concrete information, speculation is that the module seen in Shanghai is either a mock-up or construction model built to test and demonstrate the building capabilities of the shipyard to the PLAN. Still other reports have stated that the module is part of the reported Type 081 amphibious assault ship, similar to the U.S Navy\\'s Tarawa-class Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) ship. The new class will reportedly displace between 30-40,000 tons according to different sources, carry four hovercraft and up to 20 helicopters. Commissioning date is believed to be 2015.\\nWith the Liaoning training up a core of naval and air crew, developing tactics and establishing a doctrine in carrier operations while further carriers are being built, there is little doubt China looks set to be the regional carrier power in the near future.\\nOf all the nations deploying flattops in the Asia-Pacific, undoubtedly the most controversial has been Japan\\'s. Suspicion runs deep in the region about Japan\\'s true intentions despite its pacifist postwar constitution specifically banning the nation from deploying offensive weapons, fuelled by lingering anger over what is perceived as Japan\\'s failure to fully atone for its actions in World War II. With this in mind, the outcry that accompanied each launch of a Japanese flattop, classified as Helicopter-Destroyers (DDH) by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), is always predictable. But that hasn\\'t stopped Japan from being the Asia-Pacific nation with the most flight deck-equipped ships, with four in service or being built.\\nThe JMSDF commissioned the Hyuga and her sister Ise in 2009 and 2011 respectively. Displacing 13,950 tons standard and 19,000 tons fully loaded, the ships are equipped with enhanced command-and-control capabilities, allowing them to serve as flagships for the JMSDF. The ships\\' primary mission is to function as an anti-submarine warfare carrier, and four landing spots for helicopters are provided for on the flight deck, although a maximum of 11 can be carried. The irregular plan form of the flight deck and the location of the forward Phalanx Close-In Weapon System would preclude the Hyuga-class from operating fixed-wing aircraft without a substantial flight deck redesign. The normal helicopter complement is three Sikorsky SH-60K Seahawk antisubmarine helicopters and a single Agusta-Westland MCH-101 Merlin airborne mine countermeasures helicopter; however this can vary depending on the mission.\\nThe JS Hyuga was heavily involved in the HADR effort after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011. In June 2013, she became the first JMSDF ship to operate the Boeing MV-22B Osprey tiltrotor aircraft during the Dawn Blitz exercise with the U.S. Marine Corps off the coast of California.\\nOn August 6, 2013, Japan followed up with the launch of the JS Izumo, the lead ship of an even larger DDH design. Displacing 19,500 ton empty and 27,000 tons fully loaded, the Izumo and her as-yet unnamed sister will be the largest ships in the JMSDF inventory. Like the Hyuga and Ise before her, the Izumo will also be tasked primarily with anti-submarine warfare. The flight deck has five helicopter landing spots that allow simultaneous landings or take-offs, with a maximum complement of 14 helicopters theoretically possible.\\nExpected to be commissioned in 2015, the Izumo\\'s flight deck does appear to be more easily configurable to operate fixed-wing aircraft than the Hyuga class. Unsurprisingly, the Izumo\\'s launch has sparked controversy, having been described by the Chinese as an \"aircraft-carrier in disguise.\" The fact that neither the Izumo nor Hyuga-class ships are equipped with well docks for landing craft would have increased suspicion that they are designed specifically for aircraft operations.\\nSouth Korea launched the ROKS Dokdo in 2005 and commissioned it two years later. In a move that likely didn\\'t go down well in Tokyo, it took the Korean name of the islands at the center of a territorial dispute with Japan. A multi-purpose ship capable of handling a variety of missions, the Dokdo displaces 14,000 tons empty and 18,000 tons fully loaded. Three ships of the class were planned; however the third vessel was cancelled by a previous government. The second, the ROKS Marado, was to suffer the same fate, but funding was restored in 2012.\\nThe Dokdo class is capable of carrying up to 720 marines and multiple vehicles, while a well dock allows for amphibious assaults. There are five landing spots on her flight deck able to operate helicopters the size of the Sikorsky S-70 Blackhawk/Seahawk, while the hangar can accommodate a maximum of 15 helicopters of various types. The Dokdo was designed specifically to conduct \"Over the Horizon\" amphibious operations, whereby amphibious landing operations with high-speed LCACs and helicopters are launched far from the landing beaches to minimize risks to the landing ship. Her versatility has been demonstrated in 2010, when she was part of a task force conducting search and locate operations for the corvette ROKS Cheonan, which had been sunk in a North Korean sneak attack.\\nIt has been acknowledged that the Dokdo\\'s flight deck has been coated with urethane, which improves the ability of the flight deck to withstand the high temperatures of aircraft operations. However, like the JMSDF\\'s Hyuga-class, her irregular shaped flight deck and positioning of the forward CIWS would require extensive modification before fixed-wing aircraft could operate off her.\\nThailand is the oldest operator of a current carrier in the Asia-Pacific. The HTMS Chakri Naruebet was constructed by Navantia in Spain and commissioned in March 1997. Similar to the Spanish carrier Principe de Asturias, it is fitted with a 12° ski jump to operate the Royal Thai Navy\\'s (RTN) fleet of AV-8S Matador (Harrier) jets. The Chakri Naruebet was originally for Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surveillance and protection and search and rescue, but it could also be used for flagship command and control, air support for the Thai surface fleet or disaster relief.\\nDisplacing almost 11,500 tons full load, the Chakri Naruebet is the smallest aircraft carrier currently in service. She was to operate a mixed air group of Matadors and S-70B Seahawk helicopters, with the RTN purchasing ten former Spanish aircraft for the purpose. However the Asian financial crisis of 1997 put paid to those ambitions, with a lack of funding confining the Chakri Naruebet to port most of the time. The Matador fleet has also suffered accordingly, with the fleet finally being withdrawn from RTN service in 2006.\\nIn recent years the Chakri Naruebet has spent more time at sea, mostly to assist in HADR missions. She took part in relief operations in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and in response to separate flooding incidents in late 2010 and early 2011. In 2012 Saab announced that it had received an order from the Royal Thai Navy for the upgrading of the Chakri Naruebet\\'s command and control system.\\nThe F-35B Question\\nSo are these ships aircraft carriers or not? If you (rightly) consider a helicopter an aircraft, then technically the answer is yes. But to describe these ships as aircraft carriers in the traditional sense of carrying fixed-wing aircraft for offensive purposes, things become murkier. The Liaoning and Chakri are undoubtedly intended to carry fixed-wing aircraft from the outset, even if the latter hasn\\'t done so for a long while now. However, the Canberra and Izumo-class ships, while having a flight deck capable of operating Short Take Off Vertical Landing (STOVL) jets such as the Lockheed-Martin F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, would still require significant modification before they could be operational in that sense.\\nFor starters, the ships will require a thermal-resistant coating applied over the landing spots to protect the deck from the extreme temperatures during the F-35B\\'s landing cycle. Operating fast jets will also mean a large logistics support tail will require to be based on board the ship, with more hangar and storage room being taken by ammunition, spare parts and other support equipment and personnel required to support the jets. All this will require tradeoffs in space on board the ships, which will almost certainly compromise their ability to perform their other intended roles.\\nAnother major stumbling block would be that using aircraft carriers in an offensive capacity requires the carrier itself to be escorted with its own battle group. Currently none of these Pacific navies have the warships, they have yet to fully develop the naval doctrine or tactics required, and they don\\'t have air and ground crews trained to operate in this way. This is all a huge undertaking, requiring years to carry through, even with help from current carrier operators such as the U.S. Navy. Other than China, none of these navies appear to have plans for this in the near future.\\nWhile some have questioned the utility of 12-16 F-35Bs on deck in a conflict, it must be considered that despite the bad press, a fully operational F-35 will represent a game-changer in air combat as we know it. Even a dozen of these aircraft, hypothetically operating from a mini-carrier escorted by a battle group in the vast Western Pacific, will pack serious combat capability and complicate the calculus for any adversary in any conflict. However, the fact is that neither Australia, Japan or South Korea are, or have budgeted for, acquiring the F-35B, even if the former two nations have signed up for the Conventional Take Off and Landing F-35A version.\\nThis brings us to the age old issue: Money. With budgets under pressure in Australia or Japan, neither country is in a position to fund such radical changes in defense posture. Certain alarmist reports notwithstanding, the idea of aircraft carriers from regional countries trading blows in the western Pacific is, to use a maritime term, dead in the water.\\nMike Yeo is a journalist at Baseleg Aviation News and Photography.\\nAsia-Pacific navies\\nflattops\\nHMAS Canberra\\nHTMS Chakri Naruebet\\nJS Izumo\\nROKS Dokdo\\nSouth China Sea: Indonesia\\'s Natuna Sea Dilemma With China\\nHow Asia Will Make Sense of Trump\\'s Strike on Iran\\'s Soleimani\\nAssam\\'s Women at the Frontline of Protests Against India\\'s New Citizenship Law\\nPlay The Diplomat\\'s Quiz: January 19, 2020, Edition\\nPakistan\\'s JF-17 Block III Fighter Jet Makes Maiden Flight\\nYes, the Aircraft Carrier Is Still Viable\\nBy Michael Carl Haas\\nU.S. flattops are not significantly more vulnerable today.

Referring to veterans as an \"important force in the construction of socialist modernization,\" the Plan called doing work related to veterans well as \"our Party\\'s consistent fine tradition.\" It also highlighted \"using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as guidance\" and \"thoroughly implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping\\'s important exposition related to veteran work\" to accomplish tasks such as \"promot[ing] the high-quality development of veteran work.\" The Plan has six goals, namely: 1. \"amply give play to the role of political guidance\"; 2. \"comprehensively raise the quality of arranging employment\"; 3. \"[have a] more robust system for the provision of pensions and preferential treatment [to deceased veterans\\' relatives]\"; 4. \"[ensure that] the legitimate rights [of veterans] receive forceful protection\"; 5. \"[realize the] clear upgrading of capabilities to serve and support [veterans]\"; and 6. \"continuously thicken the atmosphere of honor and respect.\" In addition, it listed eight \"important priorities\": 1. \"improve the management system for veteran affairs\"; 2. \"strengthen the political and ideological guidance of veterans\"; 3. \"deepen the reform of the placement system for veterans\"; 4. \"comprehensively promote employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for veterans\"; 5. \"actively upgrade the management level of military retirement service\"; 6. \"[have a] robust guarantee system for the provision of pensions and preferential treatment [to deceased veterans\\' relatives]\"; 7. \"deepen the promotion of praise and commemoration for heroes and martyrs\"; and 8. \"amply give play to the political superiority of two supports work (双拥工作).\" The Plan also called on \"all levels of party committees, governments, and relevant civilian and military departments\" to ensure the implementation of the Plan\\'s goals and tasks.\\n(Authoritative Release) \"Opinions of the Central Committee and State Council on Doing Key Points of Comprehensively Advancing Rural Revitalization Work Well in 2022\"\\n2.22 On 22 February, Xinhua released \"Opinions of the Central Committee and State Council on Doing Key Points of Comprehensively Advancing Rural Revitalization Work Well in 2022\" (hereafter referred to as the \"Opinions\"), issued on 4 January as the No. 1 central document for 2022. The Opinions noted concerns for agriculture related to the pandemic, global economic recovery, and climate change, and the Central Committee\\'s belief that rural revitalization and agricultural policies are important for \"stable and healthy socioeconomic development.\" They stated that work on the \"three rural issues\" (三农/agriculture, rural areas, and farmers) in 2022 should closely follow various aspects of ideological and policy guidance, including following Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, implementing the spirit of the Party\\'s 19th Congress and Plenums, taking \"protecting national food security and preventing a large-scale return to poverty as the two bottom lines,\" and more. The Opinions specifically noted eight major goals of rural revitalization:\\n\"Grasp staple food production and the supply of important produce with all [our] strength\" by stabilizing year-round planting area and output of staple foods, substantially upgrading the production capacity of soybeans and oil, ensuring a stable supply of foods, ensuring that growing grains is profitable for farmers by adjusting purchasing and subsidies, and holistically regulating important agricultural products well.\\n\"Strengthen support for a modern agricultural base\" by ensuring the productive agricultural use of arable land, accomplishing staged goals for improving farmland, promoting technology for key agricultural issues, improving the development and use of agricultural equipment, developing agricultural facilities, and preventing major agricultural disasters.\\nPrevent a large-scale return to poverty by improving mechanisms to monitor aid, promoting continued increases in income for the rural population, increasing aid to key areas receiving anti-poverty aid or undergoing relocation, and promoting tangible accomplishments in anti-poverty aid.\\n\"Focus on industry to promote rural development\" by continuing to promote the integration of primary, secondary, and tertiary industry in rural areas; developing industries to enrich the people and strengthening the construction of the commerce system on the county level; promoting local employment and entrepreneurship; and promoting the green development of agriculture and rural areas.\\n\"Solidly and stably promote the construction of rural areas\" by making robust mechanisms for implementing rural construction, continuing operations for rural environmental restoration, constructing basic infrastructure in key sectors, promoting a \"digital countryside,\" and strengthening holistic planning for public services at the county level.\\nEffectively improve rural governance by strengthening the construction of grassroots Party groups, innovating \"effective platforms and media for the construction of rural spiritual civilization,\" and upholding the peace and stability of rural society.\\n\"Increase the strength of innovation for policy guarantees and systemic mechanisms\" supporting rural revitalization by expanding investment, strengthening financial services, and strengthening the construction of \"talent teams,\" as well as carrying out key rural reforms.\\n\"Persist in and strengthen the Party\\'s comprehensive leadership of \\'three rural issues\\' work\" by consolidating responsibility for rural revitalization, building strong party structures for rural work, and \"grasping points [from experience or test programs] to lead overall work in comprehensively launching rural revitalization.\"\\nWang Chen: Continuously Develop Whole-Process People\\'s Democracy and Strive to Promote the Construction of the Rule of Law in China\\n2.22 Politburo Member and China Law Society Chair Wang Chen (王晨) attended the 15th China Jurists Forum in Beijing and delivered a keynote speech. In his speech, Wang emphasized that it is necessary to \"adhere to the Party\\'s leadership, the people being the masters of their own affairs\"(当家作主), and governance based on the rule of law; \"constantly develop whole-process people\\'s democracy (全过程人民民主); ensure that the people are the masters of their own affairs by law; and strive to promote building a rule-of-law China with good laws and governance.\" He claimed that \"whole-process people\\'s democracy\" is a major achievement of the Party \"leading the people to advance democratic theoretical innovation, institutional innovation, and practical innovation,\" as well as a \"distinctive feature that distinguishes the democracy of socialism with Chinese characteristics with all kinds of bourgeois democracy (资产阶级民主) in the West.\" Wang further emphasized that the many legal practitioners in China should have a profound understanding of the major concepts of \"whole-process people\\'s democracy,\" should enhance \"historical self-confidence and institutional self-confidence,\" and \"unswervingly follow the path of socialist democratic political development with Chinese characteristics.\" He then called for \"strengthening research and propaganda related to China\\'s national system and legal system, as well as \"actively participating in the practice of socialist democratic rule of law construction.\"\\nPolitburo Discusses Government Work Report, Deliberates on \"19th Central Committee\\'s Eighth Round of Inspections Situation Summary Report,\" \"Key Work of the 2021 Central Committee Inspection Work Leading Group Situation Report,\" Xi Jinping Presides\\n2.25 Xi Jinping presided over a Politburo meeting on 25 February to discuss the State Council\\'s draft proposal of the \"Government Work Report\" passed by the National People\\'s Congress (NPC) and deliberated on a \"19th Central Committee\\'s Eighth Round of Inspections Situation Summary Report\" and \"Key Work of the 2021 Central Committee Inspection Work Leading Group Situation Report.\" The Politburo meeting discussed the achievements and challenges of 2021, and goals in preparation for the upcoming 20th Party Congress. It noted that this year, stability will be the priority of work, requiring greater implementation of macro-economic policies, deepened reform and market stimulus; implementing innovation-driven development policy, increasing domestic demand, and promoting coordinated local development, \"new-type urbanization\" (新型城镇化), agricultural production, and rural revitalization; promoting the stable development of foreign investment and trade, improving the environment and low-carbon development; reducing risks in the financial system; and improving the people\\'s livelihoods and the quality of governance. The Politburo praised the Central Committee\\'s eighth round of inspections for displaying the important function of political supervision, specifically the \"Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core\" strengthening centralized, unified leadership over financial work. At the same time, the Politburo stated that the inspections uncovered the financial sector\\'s continued problems with \"implementing the Party\\'s comprehensive leadership, strengthening Party construction, [and] comprehensively and strictly [following] party governance (全面从严治党).\" The Politburo emphasized the need for the continued strengthening of Central Committee leadership over the sector and oversight to prevent risks, maintain stability, and prevent corruption.

Reviewing the Winter Olympics, the Editorial remarked that Beijing had \"again displayed the positive spirit and power of the Chinese people to the world and wrote a new saga in the Winter Olympics movement.\" Noting that successfully holding the Winter Olympics \"fulfilled China\\'s solemn promise to the world\" and \"injected faith and power into a world [grappling with] the complications of the pandemic,\" it made three observations about the Winter Olympics: First, the Winter Olympics were \"an incomparable (无与伦比) splendid extravaganza\" that saw China\\'s performance encourage the nation through winning numerous medals. Second, the Winter Olympics were \"an extraordinary appointment that was not easy to [keep].\" The Editorial noted that China holding the Winter Olympics in the midst of the global pandemic and ensuring the safety of participants \"displayed the great power of humanity triumphing over difficulties and challenges.\" Third, it stated that the Winter Olympics were an \"outstanding demonstration of the pursuit of perfection.\" The Editorial noted that elements such as venue design and technology set a \"new benchmark for the Olympics.\" Next, it noted that the Winter Olympics showed the importance of cooperation and unity in the face of challenges and stressed three aspirations for readers: 1. \"Let us keep the original aspiration of the Olympic movement firmly in mind and jointly defend world peace\"; 2. \"Let us promote the spirit of the Olympic movement and unite to respond to common challenges [facing] the international community\"; and 3. \"Let us practice the objective of the Olympic movement and continue the undertaking of promoting the progress of mankind.\" After expressing China\\'s intent to continue in endeavors such as being a \"builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of international order,\" the Editorial concluded: \"In this season of the recovery of all living things, we are full of pride from the extravaganza of the Beijing Winter Olympics and are full of expectation for the next [Winter Olympic Games]. Let us share the great dream of the Olympics, jointly create the great glory of the Olympics, and set off together toward the more beautiful future of mankind!\"\\nZhong Sheng: [Only By] Adhering to Unity and Cooperation [Can We] Strive Toward a Bright Future\\n2.22 A Zhong Sheng (钟声) commentary focused on the 58th Munich Security Conference held from 18 to 20 February. It noted that the Conference\\'s theme of \"unlearning helplessness\" reflected the \"true social attitude of Western countries\" and was \"the embodiment of Western countries not conducting timely self-adjustment in response to changes unseen in a century (世界百年未有之大变局) due to a lack of policies to respond to global challenges.\" The commentary then gave two recommendations for \"unlearning helplessness.\" First it recommended \"establishing a correct security view that is \"shared, composite, cooperative, and sustainable\" in response to both non-traditional security issues and geopolitical tension that is increasingly global in nature and requires consultation for resolution. Second, the commentary stressed the need to \"safeguard multilateralism and the global order.\" It noted that \"individual countries\" had engaged in actions that included \"reviv[ing] Cold War thinking (冷战思维),\" \"go[ing] in big for unilateral sanctions,\" and \"esteem[ing] hegemony and bullying.\" The commentary asserted that such actions \"run counter to (背道而驰) the major trends of global multi-polarization and the democratization of international relations\" and called for countries to \"jointly construct a new type of international relations\" characterized by \"mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation (合作共赢)\" in addition to delivering other exhortations. Turning to the Conference\\'s special session on how to view China\\'s development, it cited examples such as China\\'s provision of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to show that \"a China that has more superior development quality and stronger capability for action will inevitably offer more energy for global post-pandemic recovery and make greater contributions to international peace and stability.\" The commentary concluded by stating that \"As a permanent member state of the UN Security Council and the world\\'s second-largest economy, China will play the role and function of a responsible major country (负责任大国); continue to be a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, and a defender of the international order; and join hands with all sides to jointly create a more beautiful world in the post-pandemic era.\"\\nWang Yang Presides Over CPPCC National Chairpersons\\' Meeting\\n2.23 Politburo Standing Committee Member and Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee Chair Wang Yang (汪洋) presided over and delivered a speech at the 66th Chairperson\\'s meeting of the 13th CPPCC National Committee. The meeting \"conveyed the recent important instructions and spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping on doing CPPCC work and holding the Fifth meeting of the 13th CPPCC National Committee well\" and listened to a work situation report on preparatory work for the Fifth meeting of the 13th CPPCC National Committee. In his speech, Wang highlighted the need to \"pragmatically and efficiently grasp all organization and preparatory work well [for the Fifth meeting of the 13th CPPCC National Committee]\" and \"do pandemic prevention and control work well\" in order to ensure that the meeting is a success. Turning to the convening of the 20th Party Congress later this year, he discussed conducting activities such as \"telling the stories of the Party seeking happiness for the people and national rejuvenation well and telling stories of multi-party cooperation and political consultation well, to do the work of concentrating power for the 20th Party Congress well.\" Wang also emphasized the importance of \"put[ting] forward high-quality opinions and suggestions\" and \"conducting [reviews of past work] that center around the spirit of the Central CPPCC Work Conference,\" in addition to discussing other actions. The meeting also approved the following documents: 1. \"The CPPCC National Committee 2021 democratic supervision of the implementation of 14th Five Year Plan work situation report,\" 2. \"the launching expert consultation work situation report,\" and 3. the CPPCC National Committee member independent investigation work situation report. The meeting also approved the decision to revoke the seniority of Wang Bin (王滨), Wang Pengjie (王鹏杰), Han Yi (韩沂), and Wei Yihong (魏艺红) as members of the CPPCC National Committee.\\nGeneral Office of the Central Military Commission Issues \"Opinions on Promoting the Establishment of the Base-ification and Standardization of Barracks\"\\n2.23 The General Office of the Central Military Commission (CMC) recently issued a set of Opinions on the standardization and \"base-ification\" (基地化) of barracks. Using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as \"guidance\" and \"revolving around constructing a modern military logistics system and a modern military property management system,\" the Opinions aim to help troops prepare for war and resolve issues in barracks construction such as a focus on ordinary life over preparing for and participating in combat. Containing six chapters and 22 articles, the Opinions focus on different types of layouts for bases and barracks. In addition, the Opinions also emphasize the use of features such as \"digital empowerment\" and low-carbon development in barracks design, as well as ways to improve the construction of barracks through methods such as \"guiding market entities to honestly participate in construction.\" The Opinions \"closely revolve around military strategy, training, and defense,\" \"suit the demands of reform and development for the military,\" and \"form methods for standardizing the entire process of barracks construction and management.\"\\n(Authoritative Release) Using the Historical Experience of the Party\\'s Hundred-Year Struggle to Promote the High-Quality Development of Disciplinary Inspection and Supervision Work and Welcome the Victorious Convening of the 20th Party Congress——Work Report at the CCP Sixth Plenum of the 19th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection\\n2.24 Xinhua published the text of Politburo Standing Committee Member and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) Head Zhao Leji\\'s (赵乐际) work report delivered on 18 January at the Sixth Plenum of the 19th CCDI.

Since your only concern with your implementation should be to run the stream synchronously, you should better use a Schedulers.trampoline() instead.

Additional samples were collected from the negative and solvent control groups prior to test initiation to confirm there were not measured concentrations of test substance in the control solutions. Duplicate water samples also were collected from alternating replicate test chambers in each treatment and control group at the beginning of the test, at approximately weekly intervals during the test and at the end of the test to measure concentrations of the test substance. Samples of the stock solutions being delivered to the diluter were collected for analysis on Day 11 of the study. Additional duplicate samples of test solutions were collected on Day 14 due to a test solution delivery malfunction which impacted one replicate test chamber\\nof the 25, 50 and 100 μg/L treatment groups. All samples were collected from mid-depth. Samples to be analyzed without centrifugation were collected into glass French square bottles using glass volumetric pipettes, while samples to be analyzed after centrifugation were collected into plastic centrifuge tubesusing glass graduated cylinders.\\n- Sample storage conditions before analysis:At each sampling interval one set of samples were processed immediately for analysis and one set of samples were stored for possible future analysis.\\n- Method: Individual stock solutions were prepared for each of the five concentrations tested, and were prepared six times during the study. Test solution concentrations were not adjusted for the active ingredient of the test substance during preparation, and are based on the test substance as received. The primary stock was sonicatedfor approximately 10 or 15 minutes and appeared clear and colorless, with no visible precipitates. Four secondary stock solutions were prepared in DMF at nominal concentrations of 63, 130, 250 and 500 μg/mL by proportional dilution of the primary stock. Stock solutions were stored refrigerated in glass amber bottles with Teflon®-lined lids, and aliquots of each stock were placed in the syringe every one to four days during the study.\\nThe five test substance stock solutions were injected into the diluter mixing chambers at a rate of 10.00 μL/minute where they were mixed with dilution water delivered at a rate of 100 mL/minute to achieve the desired test concentrations.\\n- Controls: The negative control received dilution water only. The solvent control was prepared by delivering HPLC-grade DMF to the mixing chamber for the solvent control.\\n- Chemical name of vehicle (organic solvent, emulsifier or dispersant):dimethylformamide (DMF)\\n- Concentration of vehicle in test medium (stock solution and final test solution(s) or suspension(s) including control(s)):A primary stock solution was prepared by mixing a calculated amount of test substance into HPLC-grade dimethylformamide (DMF) at a nominal concentration of 1000 μg/mL.

This amount of feed is equal to approximately 0.71 mg C/daphnid/day. While this amount of feed exceeds the OECD guideline recommended amount of 0.1 to 0.2 mg C/daphnid/day, an excess amount was fed in order to maintain sufficient feed in the flow-through system to support acceptable reproduction rates.\\n- Frequency: Daphnids were fed two or three times per day through Day 6 of the test and then were fed four times per day until the last day of the test.\\n- Acclimation period:\\n- Acclimation conditions (same as test or not):Adult daphnids were cultured in water from the same source and at approximately the same temperature as used during the test.\\n- Type and amount of food: as in the test\\n- Feeding frequency: as in the test\\n- Health during acclimation (any mortality observed):Adult daphnids in the culture had produced an average of at least three young per adult per day over the 7-day period prior to the test. The adults showed no signs of disease or stress and no ephippia were produced during the holding period.\\nMETHOD FOR PREPARATION AND COLLECTION OF EARLY INSTARS OR OTHER LIFE STAGES:\\nThe five adult daphnids used to supply neonates for the test were held for 24 days prior to collection of the juveniles for testing, and had each produced at least one previous brood.. To initiate the test, the juvenile daphnids were collected from the cultures and indiscriminately transferred one or two at a time to transfer chambers until each chamber contained 5 daphnids. Each group of neonates then was impartially assigned to a control or treatment group and the neonates were transferred to the test compartments to initiate the test. All transfers were made below the water surface using wide-bore pipettes.\\nflow-through\\nRemarks on exposure duration:\\n21-day exposure period under flow-through test conditions.

Nylon mesh screens covered two holes on opposite sides of each test compartment to permit test solution to flow in and out of the compartment. The depth of the test water in a representative compartment was approximately 8 cm, while the depth of water in a representative test chamber was approximately 16 cm.\\n- Aeration: Dissolved oxygen concentrations were \\uf0b37.4 mg/L (\\uf0b382% of saturation),\\n- Type of flow-through (e.g. peristaltic or proportional diluter): proportional diluter. Test chambers were 12 L glass aquaria filled with approximately 10 L of test water. The volume in the test chambers was maintained by an overflow port on the side of the test chamber.\\n- Renewal rate of test solution (frequency/flow rate):The proportion of the test solution that was pumped into each replicate test chamber was checked prior to the test and approximately weekly during the test to ensure that flow rates varied by no more than ± 5% of the mean flow rate for the replicates. The five test substance stock solutions were injected into the diluter mixing chambers at a rate of 10.00 μL/minute where they were mixed with dilution water delivered at a rate of 100 mL/minute to achieve the desired test concentrations. The negative control received dilution water only. The solvent control was prepared by delivering HPLC-grade DMF to the mixing chamber for the solvent control. The concentration of DMF in the solvent control and all F-3014 treatment groups was 0.1 mL/L.\\n- No. of organisms per vessel: Each replicate contained two compartments with five daphnids, resulting in a total of 20 daphnids in each treatment and control group\\n- No. of vessels per vehicle control (replicates): 2\\n- Biomass loading rate:\\n- Source/preparation of dilution water:Easton Well Water\\n- Total organic carbon:< 1\\n- Particulate matter:\\n- Metals: Tables presented in \"Any other information on materials and methods\" below\\n- Pesticides:Tables presented in \"Any other information on materials and methods\" below\\n- Chlorine:4.3mg/L\\n- Alkalinity:176 – 178 mg/L as CaCO3\\n- Ca/mg ratio:\\n- Conductivity:321 – 367μS/cm\\n- Culture medium different from test medium:\\n- Intervals of water quality measurement: During the 4-Week Period Immediately Preceding the Test\\nPesticides, Organics and Metals - Analyses performed by Lancaster Laboratories on samples collected on December 7, 2015\\n- Photoperiod:16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness.

There were a few observations of daphnids in the treatment groups that appeared pale, lethargic or were observed to be floating on the surface of the test solution. However, these observations were infrequent, comparable to observations in the control groups and did not follow a dose-response pattern. Therefore, these observations considered to be non-treatment related.\\n- Observations on body length and weight:Daphnids in the negative control group averaged 5.1 mm in length and 1.29 mg in dry weight, while daphnids in the solvent control group averaged 5.1 mm in length and 1.38 mg in dry weight. There were no significant differences in the growth parameters between the negative and solvent control groups (p > 0.05). Therefore, the control data were pooled for comparison with the treatment groups. Daphnids in the pooled control and the 6.6, 9.9, 24, 60 and 102 μg/L treatment groups had mean\\nlengths of 5.1, 5.1, 4.9, 5.0, 5.0 and 5.0 mm, respectively, and mean dry weights of 1.33, 1.19, 1.34, 1.32, 1.18 and 1.33 mg, respectively. According to Dunnett\\'s test, there were statistically significant decreases in mean length for the 9.9, 24 and 60 μg/L treatment groups in comparison to the pooled control (p ≤ 0.05). However, the differences were very slight (< 4%), did not follow a dose-response pattern and were likely due to the narrow standard deviations within each set of data. Therefore, the statistically significant decreases detected in the treatment groups were not considered to be biologically meaningful. There were no statistically significant decreases in mean dry weight for any F-3014 treatment group in comparison to the pooled control according to Dunnett\\'s test (p > 0.05). Consequently, the NOEC for growth (length and dry weight) was 102 μg/L, and the LOEC was >102 μg/L, the highest concentration tested.\\n- Other biological observations:Adult daphnids in the pooled control and the 6.6, 9.9, 24, 60 and 102 μg/L treatment groups produced an average of 229, 213, 210, 212, 264 and 195 live young per adult at the beginning of the test, respectively. Dunnett\\'s one-tailed test indicated there were no statistically significant decreases in the mean number of live young produced per adult at the beginning of the test in any F-3014 treatment group in comparison to the pooled control (p > 0.05). Consequently, based on the number of live young produced per adult at the beginning of the test, the NOEC was 102 μg/L and the LOEC was >102 μg/L, the highest concentration tested. Based on the number of live young produced per adult at the beginning of the test observed in the treatment groups, the 21-day EC10 and EC50 values were both determined to be >102 μg/L, the highest concentration tested.\\n- Mortality of control:After 21 days of exposure, survival in the negative control and solvent control groups was 90.0 and 95.0%, respectively. Since there were no statistically significant differences in survival between the negative and solvent control groups for any parameter tested (p > 0.05), the control data were pooled for comparisons to the treatment groups.\\n- Other adverse effects control:\\n- Abnormal responses:\\n- Any observations (e.g. precipitation) that might cause a difference between measured and nominal values:\\n- Effect concentrations exceeding solubility of substance in test medium: In the study concentartion exceed the water solubility of the substance (<1 μg/L) by at least two orders of magnitude using DMF as a carrier. \"When a laboratory test design has been specifically modified to accommodate the instability of test material or other factors likely to cause variability in test concentrations, and the design is judged adequate based on sufficient preliminary information, the study will not be rejected solely on the grounds that measured concentrations varied by more than 30 percent of the nominal concentration…The most important criterion is that the test levels must not experience a shift in \"order\". That is, the highest test level should remain highest, the next should remain second, etc.\" (9). There were no inversions of measured concentrations throughout the study. Therefore, the high variability in measured concentrations should not impact the interpretation of the study results.\\nThe cladoceran, Daphnia magna, was exposed to F-3014 at mean measured concentrations of 6.6 to 102 μg/L under flow-through conditions for 21 days. The substance concentartions exceed the water solubility value (<1 μg/L) by at least two orders of magnitude using DMF as a carrier. Nevertheless, there were no biologically meaningful, statistically significant treatment-related effects on survival, reproduction or growth at concentrations ≤102 μg/L. Consequently, the NOEC, was determined to be 102 μg/L. The LOEC and MATCH were both determined to be >102 μg/L, the highest concentration tested.\\nThe 21-day EC50 value for adult immobility was determined to be >102 μg/L, the highest concentration tested. Based on the number of live young produced per reproductive day, the 21-day EC10 and EC50 values were determined to be >102 μg/L. Based on the number of live young produced per adult at the beginning of the test, the 21-day EC10 and EC50 values were determined to be >102 μg/L.\\nThe cladoceran, Daphnia magna, was exposed to F-3014 at mean measured concentrations of 6.6 to 102 μg/L under flow-through conditions for 21 days. The substance concentartions exceed the water solubility value (<1 μg/L) by at least two orders of magnitude using DMF as a carrier. Nevertheless, there were no biologically meaningful, statistically significant treatment-related effects on survival, reproduction or growth at concentrations ≤102 μg/L.<|begin_of_text|>Ranton Abbey to be resurrected – or replaced?\\nWhen the historic Ranton Abbey was accidentally set alight and gutted in 1942 by the Dutch troops stationed there, it was likely that it would go the way of many other houses and simply be demolished. Yet the Earls of Lichfield, who owned the 300-acre estate, simply left it and focused on turning the land into a first-class shoot, allowing the house to slowly collapse, leaving just the ivy-clad walls visible today.\\nThe death of the 5th Earl, the famous photographer Patrick Lichfield, in 2005, prompted the family to look again at the estate. However, rather than simply sell it they decided to obtain planning permission for the building of a new house and have now put both for sale at £3.5m. Although an obvious course of action, the choices made seem a bit odd. The new house is strongly Palladian in design but the projections produced so far have it sited so close to the red-brick shell of the old house, and the grey stone of the church, that it seems to have almost landed there by accident. It certainly does not seem to appear at home in this location and appears almost arbitrary, resulting in three large architectural elements fighting for prominence in a small area.\\nAs the respected architectural writer Marcus Binney says in the \\'Bricks and Mortar\\' supplement of Friday\\'s Times newspaper, surely the better option would be to restore the original house. This would bring back the balance which existed before and remove at once the obvious difficulties of leaving the old house as a giant garden ornament to compete with the new house. Whoever buys the estate and planning permission will hopefully think again about this scheme and look seriously at restoration.\\nThis entry was posted in for sale, News and tagged architecture, country house, estate, fire, for sale, lord lichfield, marcus binney, planning permission, ranton abbey, restoration, staffordshire. Bookmark the permalink.\\n6 Responses to Ranton Abbey to be resurrected – or replaced?\\nI agree with everything you have said here.restoring the old house itself is surely more logical than the new one proposed.I have been researching the abbey for years now evr since going there as achil when I liveds in the local village. It is rich in history and to restore the old house would surely salute the past in all its glory.\\nHaving visited Ranton only a couple of weeks ago, I was struck by just how big the shell of the original house is. Why anyone would want to destroy good Regency craftsmanship and replace it with a classic \\'noveau-riche\\' Palladian building completely stumps me.\\nI have studied the Knight Frank brochure and all the pictures I can get hold of, and also bought a few lottery tickets, in the vain hope of being the lucky person that gets to restore a great house within the most wonderful parkland.<|begin_of_text|>To enable it: go to the Beta features tab of your Preferences and choose Visual editing.\\nTo choose your editing setting: go to the Editing tab, find Editing mode: and pick your favorite setting.

If you\\'ve ever dined at a Korean restaurant, one thing that you\\'ll experience is the various banchan, or small side dishes, that are served immediately while you wait for your meal to arrive. This cuisine is also known for the popular condiment, kim chi.\\nIn many ways, Korean cuisine is a combination of Japanese and Chinese cuisines, however unlike Japanese cuisine, Korean cuisine uses less fish and seafood and has more beef and pork heavy dishes... and unlike Chinese cuisine, Korean cuisine uses less oil. Korean foods also tend to be spicier than Japanese and Chinese dishes. The heat of the food usually comes from the chili that\\'s often used.\\nJust as in sake is in Japanese cuisine, soju is in Korean cuisine. For our Wine & Dine dinner, I also offered a soju tasting to pair with our Korean meal. Soju is an alcoholic drink which has a similar taste as vodka. Soju is unique in that it can be made from either rice, barley, sweet potato or a combination of these ingredients.\\nHere are the dishes that fellow food bloggers have submitted to my virtual Wine & Dine event! To check out what my friends and I feasted on for our dinner, feel free to check out our spread and recipes HERE. Thanks to all my fellow food bloggers for their submissions and I hope you give Korean cuisine a try soon!\\new\\'re starting this round up with a video by Greg!

The perfect example of these two factors coming together is Afterpay. The business, which launched in 2014, is the brainchild of 27-year-old Australian entrepreneur Nick Molnar and digitises the old-fashioned system of layby which saw shoppers pay off goods in installments.\\n\"What we\\'re really doing is replacing the bank of mum and dad, helping small businesses that would have had to go under or wouldn\\'t have been able to grow\"\\n\"They\\'ve grown their footprint quite aggressively and quickly.

Another business tapping into this is small business loan provider Prospa. The five-year-old company has recently reached the milestone of issuing 10,000 loans to small business owners to the tune of $350 million. \"We\\'re on a mission to change the way small business owners experience finance,\" says Anna Fitzgerald, senior marketing manager at Prospa.\\nWhile it may appear Prospa is playing in a space traditional banks have long owned, as Fitzgerald points out, there has long been an unserviced customer base.\\n\"There is something like 2.1 million small business in Australia and traditionally, banks have not lent to that sector because they didn\\'t have the risk appetite for it. What we\\'re really doing is replacing the bank of mum and dad, helping small businesses that would have had to go under or wouldn\\'t have been able to grow,\" says Fitzgerald.\\n\"I don\\'t think the amount of time that you\\'ve been around is necessarily going to give you an advantage – it\\'s the culture you develop and the way you innovate as an organisation.\"\\nBy tapping into a client base banks have been unable to service opens up the opportunity for a partnership between the startup and traditional financial organisations. Accordingly, Prospa has forged a partnership with Westpac.\\n\"We\\'re running a pilot program so that when they\\'re unable to help a small business customer because they don\\'t have a product that suits their requirements, they refer them to us,\" explains Fitzgerald.\\nAs Net Promoter Scores for traditional banking organisations continue to languish in the negative digits, Fitzgerald believes banks can benefit from teaming up with startups such as Prospa which is seeing NPS ranging from 30 to 70, even in instances when the loan application is not approved.\\n\"The two key things we offer are speed and simplicity,\" she says.\\nCatch more of the world\\'s brightest minds at Global Forum 2018.

They moved to the United States after his dad was offered a job as an electrical engineer in El Paso.\\nMario was born three years later. His parents wanted him to have the best education possible, so they started researching schools and colleges when Mario was only a baby. His mother was especially dedicated to his future and went above and beyond for his education.\\n\"My parents, in their mid 20\\'s, moved to a new country with almost nothing to their name. I often think about how exciting and terrifying the move must have been. They did everything within their power to give me a chance at a better life. My mother learned of a grade school that was known for its strong academic reputation but when she inquired about enrolling me, there were only two spots left and they would be given on a first-come first-served basis at 7 a.m. the very next day. Undeterred, my mom spent the night in the parking lot of what would become my grade school. When the doors opened at 7 a.m. the next morning, she was the second parent in line and I was the last student registered.\"\\nYoung Mario with his mother\\nWhen it was time for Mario to enroll in high school, his parents weren\\'t familiar with the American high school to college pipeline. Mario and his parents researched together and discovered that Cathedral High School, a private, Catholic high school in El Paso, maintained a 100% college acceptance rate, but tuition was expensive for the family.\\n\"In El Paso and Matamoros, college is more often a dream than a possibility. My mom, with the same tenacity she showed in enrolling me for kindergarten, found every single scholarship I could apply for and by the first day of school, I was an enrolled student at Cathedral High School and on my path to college.\"\\nMario eventually enrolled at Stanford University, graduating in 2013 with a B.A. in Science, Technology, and Society. While he was there, he joined and led an organization dedicated to providing need-based scholarships to graduating high school students attending two-year or four-year institutions.\\n\"Being a first-generation, low-income student of Hispanic descent in higher education was the exception, not the norm. I looked for a community of individuals with backgrounds similar to my own, which I found in joining and leading an organization called Los Hermanos de Stanford. As a group, we fundraised annually to provide need-based scholarships to graduating high school students attending two-year colleges and universities. I felt that I was reciprocating the investment so many people had made in me over the years. At that point, I knew how I wanted to use my life– helping students from difficult circumstances earn access to life-changing opportunities.\\nMario and his family at his college graduation in 2013.\\nAfter college, Mario accepted a position with Teach for America as a 1st-grade language instructor. He loved working with students and noticed how they were impacted by family circumstances or obstacles that he could not help with through teaching alone. He realized that he wanted to scale his impact beyond the classroom. He returned home to work at his alma mater, Cathedral High School, as the Director of Admissions.\\n\"For those three years at Cathedral, I conveyed the dream of a better life to every student and parent who walked the halls of our school. Throughout my tenure at Cathedral High School, I succeeded in increasing the number of underserved students and the dollar amount of scholarships that we could provide them. On a daily basis I had the opportunity to help change the course of a young person\\'s life. Working at Cathedral was an honor, the most fun I have ever had, and will forever be one of my proudest accomplishments..\"\\nMario\\'s \"Why McCombs?\"\\nMario never imagined he would end up in business school. But while driving around El Paso, he would see a Texas McCombs MBA billboard, and it stuck in his mind.\\n\"Truth be told, I did not think I\\'d get into business school. I wasn\\'t sure if top business schools would see the value of my experience in education. I was hard on myself, thinking that perhaps I wasn\\'t good enough. But my friends and colleagues encouraged me to put forth my best effort and believe in myself– and so I did. I reminded myself that I was worthy and deserving of receiving additional education. I\\'m blessed to be surrounded by good people, and I\\'m so grateful I didn\\'t give up.\"\\nMario says what sealed his decision to come to McCombs was his experience at Discover McCombs: Diversity Weekend and the opportunity to apply to McCombs through The Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, an alliance of top business schools and companies committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in global business education and leadership.\\n\"When I came to Austin for Diversity Weekend, I had not applied to The Consortium, an organization that provides access to MBA admissions resources for underrepresented students. Jaden Felix, my McCombs admissions officer, took note of that and vehemently encouraged me to apply. To me, someone who has always looked for a community, it was a sign that I would be cared for here at McCombs.\\nMario had seen first-hand that even a well-funded, prestigious school like Cathedral couldn\\'t circumvent every challenge that students face or provide enough aid for every student to attend. He hopes that business school can help him achieve his goal of launching and operating a school that houses an ecosystem of academic and non-academic support for its students and their families.\\n\"For every student I was able to enroll at Cathedral or secure a scholarship for, there were at least a handful more that I could not because of socioeconomic reasons, lack of school resources, etc. Cathedral does a lot of good for so many students, myself included, and all kids deserve a good school with people who genuinely care about their success. I decided to pursue an MBA because I want to dedicate my life toward scaling the impact of schools located in underrepresented and underserved communities.\"\\nMario\\'s Advice to You\\n\"The great thing about McCombs is that the people here, from the staff to students and alumni, have reiterated one common phrase: \\'Don\\'t forget why you came here.\\' To me, this phrase serves as a constant reminder to remember how I have benefited from the kindness and help of others, and my responsibility to do the same.\"\\n\"Don\\'t devalue your experiences and don\\'t worry about not having the perfect academic or professional profile. I like to think that Texas McCombs, more so than other schools, tries to find people who have made a real impact in whatever capacity they served and genuinely want to do good in the world.\"\\nStay up to date with all things McCombs by subscribing to our newsletter.

The successful PCS100 AVC range has been upgraded with a new 400 V range. This is a fully rated product at 400 V and can be applied to 380, 400 and 415 V networks. Previously 400 VAC rated PCS100 AVCs were down rated versions of 480 VAC rated units. This provides an additional 20 percent kVA capacity at no cost.\\nThis versatile product will find acceptance in 380 V countries such as China, 400 V regions such as Europe, the majority of Asia, South America, and for a smaller number of countries using 415 V such as Malaysia. The PCS100 AVC 400 V series is compatible with both 50 and 60 Hz supplies so countries such as Japan or OEM\\'s dealing with both frequencies will find products held in stock to be readily applicable to either network.\\nThe benefits for the end user are a lower cost per kVA and a smaller footprint for a given rating. The immediate saving and reduced real estate required for new installations or the sometimes challenging retrofit applications are a \"win-win\" situation for ABB\\'s customers.\\nAll 400 V range products sold are CE certified and suitable for global markets with a range of languages available on the graphical display. As part of the modular PCS100 product portfolio, spare parts are rationalized and available on short notice with ABB\\'s back-up and support.\\nThe PCS100 AVC 400 V series is an ideal solution for demanding voltage conditioning applications providing continuous regulation and near instantaneous correction of voltage sags and surges. The improved features and performance of the 400 V PCS100 AVC will see it even more widely applied in applications as diverse as, semiconductor and industrial plant protection through to medical and data centers. Typically, wherever critical loads require continuous clean power, the PCS100 AVC 400 V series will provide continuous benefits to the end user in the commercial and industrial sectors.<|begin_of_text|>Non-localized standing waves of the hyperbolic cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation\\nDCDS Home\\nOn the partitions with Sturmian-like refinements\\nAugust 2015, 35(8): 3503-3531. doi: 10.3934/dcds.2015.35.3503\\nBoundedness in quasilinear Keller-Segel equations with nonlinear sensitivity and logistic source\\nXie Li 1, and Zhaoyin Xiang 1,\\nSchool of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731\\nReceived November 2014 Revised December 2014 Published February 2015\\nIn this paper, we investigate the quasilinear Keller-Segel equations (q-K-S): \\\\[ \\\\left\\\\{ \\\\begin{split} &n_t=\\\\nabla\\\\cdot\\\\big(D(n)\\\\nabla n\\\\big)-\\\\nabla\\\\cdot\\\\big(\\\\chi(n)\\\\nabla c\\\\big)+\\\\mathcal{R}(n), \\\\qquad x\\\\in\\\\Omega,\\\\,t>0,\\\\\\\\ &\\\\varrho c_t=\\\\Delta c-c+n, \\\\qquad x\\\\in\\\\Omega,\\\\,t>0, \\\\end{split} \\\\right. \\\\] under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain $\\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^N$. For both $\\\\varrho=0$ (parabolic-elliptic case) and $\\\\varrho>0$ (parabolic-parabolic case), we will show the global-in-time existence and uniform-in-time boundedness of solutions to equations (q-K-S) with both non-degenerate and degenerate diffusions on the non-convex domain $\\\\Omega$, which provide a supplement to the dichotomy boundedness vs. blow-up in parabolic-elliptic/parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis equations with degenerate diffusion, nonlinear sensitivity and logistic source. In particular, we improve the recent results obtained by Wang-Li-Mu (2014, Disc. Cont. Dyn. Syst.) and Wang-Mu-Zheng (2014, J.

Fatty liver disease is the result of a build-up of fat in the liver. If the liver is healthy, there should be little or no fat in it. However, sometimes, fat molecules begin to collect in the liver cells. Small amounts of fat in the liver usually cause no problems. However, when too much fat builds in this organ, it can pose a lot of health hazards.\\nWith the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ and second largest organ in the body. Its function is to process everything we eat or drink and filter harmful substances from the blood. This process is however interrupted when the liver contains too much fat. When fat accounts for more than five percent of the liver\\'s weight, the condition is described as fatty liver.\\nIt is becoming one of the most common types of liver disease and it\\'s also one of the causes of liver cancer and cirrhosis. The disease may also occur due to metabolic problems such as diabetes, obesity or Hepatitis B and C infection.\\nA diagnosis of fatty liver could raise the alarm for an impending Type 2 diabetes. Fatty liver disease can lead to an inflamed liver and scarring. This is called alcoholic hepatitis if it\\'s caused by drinking too much alcohol and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis if it\\'s not related to alcohol.\\nFrom what I have explained so far, it should be obvious that fatty liver disease is a lifestyle disease. Most people living with this disease are fat, obese and they take alcohol.\\nIt is more common in men and persons above the age of 50. Hypertensive and diabetic patients are most likely to be diagnosed with fatty liver as they are already battling with high blood sugar, glucose and cholesterol.\\nHowever, chemicals like methotrexate and tamoxifen can, but rarely cause non-alcoholic fatty liver.\\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease usually causes no signs and symptoms. When it does, they may include fatigue, poor appetite, pain in the upper right abdomen and weight loss.\\nIts complications include a swollen abdomen, itchy skin, vomiting of blood, confusion or poor memory, weakness and muscle wasting and jaundice.\\nFatty liver disease can sometimes be difficult to diagnose because one may not have any symptoms. There is no single test that can be used to diagnose fatty liver disease, but one may carry out some blood tests, liver biopsy, ultrasound, CT or MRI scan which help to create images of the liver. These images will show if there are any forms of fat in the liver.\\nYou may be able to prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by maintaining a healthy weight for your height. Being active try to do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week or 30 minutes of exercise for days.\\nThose who are obese or overweight, a gradual weight loss and regular exercise is advised. This not only helps with fatty liver but also it will help to reduce other risks of developing cardiovascular problems.\\nLimit or avoid alcoholic beverages because alcohol even in modest amounts may make fatty liver worse.\\nEating healthy foods that are low in saturated fat and reduce your sugar intake to control your blood sugar. Manage your cholesterol levels and use liver supplements.\\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease is reversible. The liver should return to normal if one stops drinking alcohol. Even if one has been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping alcohol intake will have important short and long-term benefits on the liver and one\\'s overall health.\\new send periodic newsletter to keep you well informed on current Health issues and news in Nigeria\\nTweets by @9ja_health\\n© Copyright 2015 - 9jahealth.

The surgical instruments include a needle body and an anchor coupled to the needle body. The anchor is adapted and configured for engaging and retracting the hollow organ, and can be held and deployed from within the needle body or from an outside surface of the needle body. The needle body defines an aperture for permitting aspiration of contents of the hollow organ.\\nThis application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Patent Application Set. No. 61/291,842, filed Dec. 31, 2009 and U.S. Patent Application Set. No. 61/323,359, filed Apr. 13, 2010, which are incorporated herein by reference, in their entireties.\\nThe present invention relates to surgical procedures. Particularly, the present invention is directed to devices for laparoscopic surgical procedures, and more particularly to devices for use in single-incision laparoscopic surgical (SILS) procedures. The subject surgical devices are deployed, in accordance with one aspect, from within the lumen of a needle or from an outer surface of a needle. Such devices are sometimes termed \"needlescopic.\" U.S. Patent Publications Numbers US 2010/0016884, US 2009/0259225, US 2008/0086166, US 2007/0282170, US 2007/0250112, US 2007/0213767, US 2007/0213766, and US 2007/0213595, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, describe devices related to the devices described herein. The devices described therein, and aspects thereof, including configuration of control mechanisms, material selection, fabrication techniques, as well as other aspects, can be applied to the devices described herein, with advantageous effect.\\nGallbladder surgery has been revolutionized in recent years, changing from an open incisional surgery to, currently, almost a purely laparoscopic procedure, also known as a minimally invasive surgery. Conventional minimally invasive surgeries for cholecystectomy involve the use of four trocars (access devices). In general, one trocar is inserted in the umbilicus, through which an endoscope is inserted, with two trocars being inserted on the right side of the abdomen for retraction and mobilizing the gallbladder, in order to identify the important structures. The fourth trocar is typically inserted in the midline above the umbilicus.\\nThe aforementioned method has become the standard approach and has withstood twenty years of changes in surgical skill sets, in various groups of surgeons. Relatively recently, even newer and advantageous techniques for cholecystectomy have been developed that involve only a single trocar or \"port\", called SILS (single incision laparoscopic surgery). The prediction is that nearly twenty to forty percent of all gallbladder surgeries will be performed in this manner in the next five to ten years. This technology involves inserting a single port inserted through the umbilicus, with all the instruments going into the abdominal cavity through the single port. Mobilizing and retracting the gallbladder is challenging with this technology, especially if the gallbladder is distended due to inflammation.\\nThere are techniques available at present for anchoring the fundus of the gallbladder with sutures during SILS procedures, although such techniques are very cumbersome and difficult, especially with an inflamed gallbladder.\\nApplicants recognize that aspirated, emptied gallbladders are preferable if using SILS technology for cholecystectomy, thus changing what was a tense, full sac, into a malleable structure permitting instruments to grasp the wall of the gallbladder. Applicants further recognize that simply aspirating with a needle alone, and not sealing the opening caused thereby, will cause spillage of left-over materials, which is not desirable.\\nAccordingly, there remains a need in the art for devices that facilitate aspiration and retraction of gallbladder in laparoscopic procedures that prevent spillage of gallbladder contents. The present invention provides a solution for these needs.\\nIn one aspect, a surgical instrument for laparoscopic procedures is provided, which is adapted and configured to aspirate and retract a hollow organ. The surgical instrument includes a needle body, an anchor, deployable with respect to the needle body, adapted and configured for engaging and retracting the hollow organ, and an aperture provided in connection with the needle body, adapted and configured for permitting aspiration of contents of the hollow organ.\\nThe hollow organ can be a gallbladder. The anchor can be held within, and deployable from, a lumen of the needle body. The anchor can be held on, and deployable from, an outside surface of the needle body.\\nThe anchor can be a deployable cage structure. The cage structure can be spring-biased such that the cage structure is deployed by tension provided in a spring when the cage structure extends beyond the needle body by a predetermined distance. The cage structure can include one or more barbs configured to extend from the cage structure when the cage structure is in a deployed configuration. Such one or more barbs can be distally directed to facilitate reinsertion of the cage structure into the lumen of the needle body. Alternatively, such one or more barbs can be proximally directed to facilitate engagement of the barbs with the inner wall of the hollow organ. The cage can be configured so that the barbs move into a position coplanar with surrounding portions of the cage, to facilitate reinsertion of the cage into the lumen of the needle body.\\nThe cage structure can be provided with at least one fenestration to facilitate bending manipulation of the cage.\\nThe cage structure can be provided with a plurality of legs, symmetrically arranged about a longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument. The number of legs can be any or two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine, for example. However, greater or fewer legs, such as one or ten and so on, can be provided.\\nThe cage structure can include a plurality of nested cages to permit flexibility of the cage while maintaining strength sufficient to reliably retract the hollow organ.\\nIn accordance with another aspect of the invention, the anchor can be a deployable wire structure.\\nAlternatively, the anchor an inflatable structure. The anchor can be adapted and configured to be inflatable by one or more of a liquid and a gas.\\nThe anchor can include a distal anchor portion and a proximal anchor portion, adapted and configured to engage inner and outer surfaces of the hollow organ, respectively. The distal anchor portion and the proximal anchor portion can be longitudinally spaced apart by a distance sufficient to permit engagement of a wall of the hollow organ. If desired, the distal anchor portion and the proximal anchor portion can be rotationally offset from one another by about 90 degrees, with respect to a longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument. Alternatively, the distal anchor portion and the proximal anchor portion can be substantially parallel with one another, with respect to a longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument.\\nThe distal anchor portion and the proximal anchor portion can be of substantially the same configuration. Alternatively, the distal anchor portion and the proximal anchor portion can be of dissimilar configurations, such as in structure, number of elements, size, material, or in other aspects thereof.\\nIn accordance with the invention, the needle body can include a sharpened distal tip. A deployable tip protector can further be provided to inhibit unintentional injury by a sharpened distal tip of the needle body. The deployable tip protector can be a translatable sheath adapted and configured to be deployed over the sharpened distal tip of the needle body. Alternatively, the deployable tip protector can be a translatable plug adapted and configured to be deployed from within a lumen of the needle body. The plug can be adapted and configured to extend distally beyond the sharpened distal tip of the needle body, to inhibit piercing of a structure by the needle body, when in a deployed position. The plug can be formed from a polymeric material.\\nIn accordance with the invention, an aperture can be provided at the distal end of the body. Alternatively, one or more apertures can be provided in a distal end portion of a sidewall of the body.\\nThe anchor can be formed at least in part from one of a shape-memory alloy and a stainless steel. Alternatively, resilient polymeric materials of sufficient strength, flexibility and durability can be used. In accordance with the invention, the anchor can be formed at least in part by laser cutting.\\nThe needle body can be any length necessary. In accordance with one aspect, the length is about 20 centimeters. An outer diameter of the needle body can be any size necessary. In accordance with one aspect, the diameter is about 2 mm.\\nThe anchor can be configured such that, in a deployed conformation, a width, measured transverse to a longitudinal axis thereof, is a maximum of about eight times that of a width in a collapsed conformation, measured transverse to the longitudinal axis thereof.\\nThe needle body can be provided with a sharpened end surface angled at about 35 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis of the needle body.\\nA handle can be provided in connection with the subject instruments, to facilitate manipulation thereof.\\nIn accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a method of retracting a hollow organ is provided, comprising the steps of inserting a body through an abdominal wall of a patient, inserting the body through a wall of the hollow organ, aspirating contents from the hollow organ, deploying a first anchor portion within the hollow organ, to engage an inner surface of the hollow organ, and retracting the hollow organ.\\nIn accordance with the invention, the method can further include the step of deploying a second anchor portion outside the hollow organ to engage an outer surface of the hollow organ.\\nIn accordance with still another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument for laparoscopic procedures is provided, which is adapted and configured to aspirate and retract a gallbladder, the instrument having means for aspirating contents from a gallbladder, and means for engaging and retracting the gallbladder.\\nIn accordance with still a further aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument can be manufactured by a process comprising the steps of providing a tubular needle with a lumen extending therethrough, machining a deployable anchor, and inserting the deployable anchor, in a radially collapsed conformation, into the tubular needle. The anchor can be formed from a flat stainless steel stock material. The step of machining can be performed by electrical discharge machining or laser machining, for example.\\nIt is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and are not intended to be limiting.\\nFIG. 54 is a side view of a distal end portion of the surgical aspirator-retractor of FIG. 53, having distal deployable ribbon-shaped engagement elements and proximal deployable prong-shaped engagement elements, with all elements in a deployed configuration.\\nReference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.\\nIn accordance with one aspect of the invention, a surgical aspirator-retractor is provided having the capacity to aspirate and seal a hole formed thereby, as well as retract the gallbladder. In accordance with one aspect, a needle of less than 2.5 mm is introduced into the abdominal wall with a sharp tip which can pierce the skin. The same needle tip is able to pierce the fluid-filled gallbladder wall. The opposite end to the needle tip can be provided with a hub to attach a syringe or suction device to help to aspirate the contents of the gallbladder. Once the gallbladder is emptied of its contents, the surgical aspirator-retractor\\'s anchor or fixation mechanism can be deployed.\\nIn accordance with the invention, the distal anchor or fixation mechanism can include, for example, multiple curved wires coming out of the sharp end of the needle, multiple curved wires coming out of the shaft near the needle tip, an outer shaft over the needle having a shape-memory alloy wire attached to two ends and when pushed down, the wire assumes the shape of a rosette. Depending on the precise implementation, the needle tip can be split at the end and when retracted backwards can become the shape of a star. If desired, a separate instrument can be provided having a compressed hook, introduced at the proximal end of a needle body. When the separate instrument is inserted through and beyond a distal end of the needle body, it is deployed, and the hook engages the inside of the gallbladder wall.\\nDepending on the precise embodiment, once this distal anchor portion is deployed, the whole instrument is withdrawn until the sharp tip of the anchor engages and fixes to the inside of the gallbladder wall firmly. Optionally, a second anchor portion can be provided to engage the outer surface of the wall of the gallbladder to facilitate a secure grasp. The gallbladder can then be retracted or mobilized in any direction without any spillage. Once the gallbladder dissection from the liver is complete, the anchor mechanism is either retracted into the instrument or otherwise straightened, thus releasing its attachment from the gallbladder wall. The instrument will then be withdrawn from the gallbladder wall.\\nIt should be noted that although the devices of the present invention are advantageous for cholecystectomy procedures, they can advantageously be applied to aspirate, retract and/or stabilize other hollow organs, such as the stomach or urinary bladder, for example. Further, devices in accordance with the invention can be used to manipulate other tissues including organs, in addition to those that are substantially hollow.\\nDevices in accordance with the invention advantageously help empty the contents from the organ with which it is being used, such as the gallbladder, without spillage, and facilitate easy grasping of the wall of the thereof because of loss of distensability of the organ wall is reduced. The subject devices also permit easy removal of the gallbladder from the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port due to the collapsed state of the organ. Further, advantageously, the small size of the subject instruments minimize or eliminate scarring.\\nFor the purposes of explanation and illustration, and not limitation, in accordance with the invention, an exemplary embodiment of a surgical aspirator-retractor 100 is illustrated in FIGS. 1-14. In accordance with this example, the surgical aspirator-retractor includes an inner needle having a diameter, for example 1.5 mm, and a needle body 130 having diameter d1, for example about 2 mm, with a length L1, for example about 200 mm.\\nAs illustrated in FIGS. 11-14, which illustrate use of the surgical aspirator-retractor of FIG. 1, in piercing, aspirating contents of and retracting a gallbladder, respectively, the aspirator-retractor 100 can be positioned directly over the gallbladder 991 then inserted directly through the skin of the abdominal wall 990, into the gallbladder 991, by virtue of a sharpened distal tip 131. A suction source can be hooked up to a fitting 115, such as a Luer fitting provided on the body 110, and the gallbladder is aspirated of its contents 993, such as bile, from the lumen 995 thereof, via a distal end aspiration aperture 135 therein. The thumb wheel 120 can then be advanced to deploy the anchor 140, which in the illustrated embodiment is in the form of a cage with hooks or barbs 141 to engage or embed into the gallbladder 991, for retention thereof. The surgical aspirator-retractor 100 is then pulled up setting the tips of the cage into the gallbladder internally. The surgical aspirator-retractor 100 can then be pulled up and the gallbladder is raised to the desired position. The position locking mechanism 150 is placed against the skin and locked, thereby suspending the gallbladder in the body cavity allowing work to be performed on it and around it without having to reposition the gallbladder continually.\\nAs best seen in the detail views of FIGS. 4 and 5, an outer shaft 133 is provided concentrically outside of the needle body 130, and is attached to the proximal end of the anchor 140, while the distal end of the anchor 140 is attached to the needle body. Such attachment can be achieved by integral forming process, welding, crimping, mechanical fasteners, adhesives or another suitable technique, if desired.\\nFIGS. 6 and 7 are is an isometric detail views of the distal anchor portion 140 of the surgical aspirator-retractor 100, but with a solid tip 132 and apertures 137 for aspiration on a side surface thereof, shown in a collapsed condition and a deployed condition, respectively.\\nIn accordance with a further exemplary embodiment, as illustrated for example, in FIGS. 15-22, a surgical aspirator-retractor 200 is provided with a needle body 230, a distal anchor 240, a handle 210, a proximal fitting 215 and a position locking mechanism 150. The needle body 230 can have, in accordance with one example embodiment, a diameter of about 1.5 mm and a length of between about 150 mm and 200 mm.\\nAs best seen in FIGS. 19-22, which illustrate use of the surgical aspirator-retractor of FIG. 15, in piercing, aspirating contents of and retracting a gallbladder, respectively, as with the above-described embodiment, the aspirator-retractor 200 can be positioned over the gallbladder 991, and then inserted directly through the abdominal wall 990, into the lumen 995 of the gallbladder 991. Suction can then be hooked up to the luer fitting 215 on the end thereof, and the gallbladder 991 is aspirated of its contents 993, such as bile. Suction can then be turned off and the anchor 240 advanced, as shown in FIG. 21, to expose a single or multiple needle tips (e.g., similar to a grappling hook). As shown in FIG. 22, the surgical aspirator-retractor 200 is then pulled up setting the needles into the inner surface of the wall of the gallbladder 991. Then, the surgical aspirator-retractor 200 is pulled up and the gallbladder is raised to the desired position. The position locking mechanism 150 is placed against the skin and locked, thereby suspending the gallbladder in the body cavity allowing work to be performed on it and around it without having to continually reposition the gallbladder 991.\\nFIGS. 23-31 show various views an additional embodiment of a surgical aspirator-retractor in accordance with the present invention, having a deployable cage-shaped anchor 340.\\nBy way of example, the needle body 130 is provided as a hollow needle. In accordance with one aspect, the diameter of the needle body 130 can be about 2.1 mm. In use, the needle body is inserted through the abdomen under internal observation. The needle body 130 is inserted into the gallbladder 991 and fluids are aspirated through the needle body 130. A shaft 340, which may be formed from a tubular material, and being internal to the needle body 130, is advanced distally to deploy the expandable cage-shaped anchor 340, which is affixed to the front of the tube 338. A shaft 343 runs through a lumen of the tube 338, and is attached to the distal portion of the anchor cage 340. As best seen in FIG. 27, a spring 345 is provided and is secured to the shaft 343, thus spring loading the anchor cage 340, under tension applied thereto. When the anchor cage 340 is advanced beyond the needle body 130, the tension of the spring 345 causes the cage to expand up to a stop. Bending of the anchor cage 340 exposes grip fingers or barbs 341 that secure the inside of the gall bladder 991.\\nIn use, the internal components are typically recessed inside the 2.1 mm hollow needle body 130. The needle body 130 is then inserted through the abdomen and then into the gallbladder 991. Fenestrations 349 facilitate achieving the desired structural properties of the anchor cage 340, and also permit fluids to be aspirated past the distal tip of the anchor cage 340. Once the gallbladder 991 is aspirated, the anchor cage 340 is advanced through the needle body 130, and into the lumen 995 of the gallbladder 991. In accordance with one aspect, the anchor cage 340 expands outwardly, to a maximum width of about 16 mm. In the illustrated embodiment, the barbs 341 face distally, so that there are no edges to catch on the needle body 130, when the cage 340 is drawn back into the needle body 130.\\nAfter insertion within the lumen 995 of the gallbladder 991 and deployment of the anchor 340, the aspirator-retractor can be manipulated such as by rotation or axial translation, to facilitate access to the gallbladder 991. Once removed, the gallbladder 991 is placed in a bag, for example, and the anchor cage 340 is retracted to release the gallbladder 991 from the aspirator-retractor, which is then removed from the patient.\\nTo retract the anchor cage 340, the inner drive tube 338 is retracted. The gallbladder is then stripped from the aspirator-retractor. The anchor cage 340 is then returned to its original position and the needle body 130 is removed from the abdomen.\\nIn accordance with the invention, the anchor cage 340 is assembled by any suitable technique, to the inner tube 338, such as by welding, soldering or crimping. In accordance with the invention, the shaft 343 can be connected to the anchor cage 340 by a threaded connection, or other suitable technique.\\nDue to the high amount of flex and associated strain placed on the cage, material must be selected accordingly. Shape memory alloys or any suitable materials can be used. In accordance with one aspect, a high strength stainless steel alloy is used in cased of thin cross-sections, to maintain stresses below their tensile limits. In accordance with the invention, 17-7PH Condition C stainless steel with a post forming heat-treatment to condition CH900 can be utilized for this application. In accordance with the invention, such a material can have a tensile strength of approximately 250,000 psi and elongation of 3% expected, with minimal part distortion during heat-treatment. If desired, a flash electropolish and subsequent low temperature bake to prevent Hydrogen embrittlement can be used to remove heat tint during 900 degree F. open air precipitation age hardening.\\nFIG. 30 is an isometric view of a distal anchor 340 of a surgical aspirator-retractor having a deployable cage configuration, which is similar in many respects to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 23. The anchor cage 440 differs there from in that it includes a plurality of nested layers 440 a, 440 b, and additional fenestrations 449, to promote strength while facilitate a reliable change in conformation thereof in use. FIG. 31 is a detail isometric view of the distal anchor portion 440 of the surgical aspirator-retractor of FIG. 30. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the anchor cage 340 and/or the anchor cage portions 440 a, 440 b can be formed from a stainless steel material having about a 0.002 inch stock thickness.\\nWith reference to FIGS. 32-34, still another embodiment of a surgical aspirator-retractor in accordance with the present invention is illustrated, having a distal anchor 540 in a variation of the above-described deployable cage structures. The distal anchor 540 includes outwardly expanding ribbons of material 540 a, 540 b. A main needle body 530 is provided, axially inner to other components. A deployable tip protector 537 is also provided. As illustrated in FIG. 32, the tip protector 537 is here illustrated as a sheath which can be deployed by manipulating respective concentric tube(s), such as one provided radially outward from the main needle body 530. As best seen in FIG. 34, when a compressive force is applied distally on the ribbons 540 a, 540 b, they expand radially outwardly, as with other embodiments described herein, due to the configuration thereof and material selection therefore.\\nFIGS. 35-36 illustrate a further embodiment of a surgical aspirator-retractor in accordance with the present invention having a distal deployable anchor 640 as a deployable cage, formed by axially offset pairs of outwardly expanding anchor portions 640 a, 640 b, which are generally ribbon-shaped in configuration.\\nIn accordance with the invention, the needle body 630 can be configured as desired. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the needle body 630 has about a 2.1 mm outer diameter and 225 mm length. A safety plug 639 can be provided for the same reason as the sheath 537 of the above-described embodiment, namely to inhibit unintentional trauma to the patient when the needle body 130 is not intentionally and actively being inserted through anatomy. In the safe position illustrated in FIG. 35, a sharp tip of the needle body 630 is shielded by the plug 639, which extends distally past the tip thereof.\\nConversely, to pierce a structure, the plug 639 is retracted by withdrawing the cage 640 proximally. Suction applied to a central lumen allows for aspiration of contents through the lumen, around the plug 639. Alternatively or additionally, fluid can be aspirated through the (four) fenestrations in the needle body 630 provided for the expanding anchor portions 640 a, 640 b. Aspirated contents can be carried through an inner tube and to the connected suction system.\\nLater, for deployment of the anchor portions 640 a, 640 b, the cage 640 is urged distally, which also results in the plug 639 being placed in the safety position. In the illustrated embodiment, tabs formed by on respective legs of the cage 640 engage respective slots in a pushing element, or expander 642 and a pusher tip 644. The expander 642 and pusher tip 644 can be welded to respective inner and outer tubes, such as actuator 646, that can be move axially relative to one another, to enable control of deployment of the cage 640.\\nIn use, an inner tube (not illustrated) connected to the expander 642, can be advanced distally to deploy the distal grasper portions 640 b, within the gallbladder. The whole aspirator-retractor can then be retracted proximally until the set of distal anchor portions 640 b are engaged with an inner surface of the gallbladder wall. The outer tube 646, connected to the pusher 644 can then be advanced to open the proximal grasper portions 640 a, to expand on the outside of the gallbladder, sandwiching the wall of the gallbladder therebetween.\\nThus, the aspirated gallbladder is securely held by the aspirator-retractor and is able to be manipulated by the surgeon while it is dissected from connecting vessels and tissues. In accordance with one aspect, the gallbladder can then be placed in an endoscopic collection bag and both inner and outer tubes can be retracted to pull the anchor portions 640 a, 640 b inside of the needle body 630, to release the gallbladder. Subsequently, the aspirator-retractor can then be removed from the abdomen and discarded.\\nAs with other embodiments set forth herein, the illustrated configuration of an aspirator-retractor can be integrated with handles described herein.\\nAs with other embodiments described herein, the anchor portions 640 a, 640 b extend through respective apertures, which are formed, in this case, in the needle body 630 by a suitable technique, such as by laser cutting.\\nIn accordance with one aspect, the anchor cage portions 640 a, 640 b can be formed of a 0.005 inch-thick, full hard stainless steel, or another suitable material. The Anchor cage 640 can be formed from a single or a plurality of nested layers.\\nVarious additional alternative embodiments of aspirator-retractors in accordance with the invention are provided, as follows.\\nFIG. 37 is an isometric view of a distal end portion of a further embodiment of a surgical aspirator-retractor 700 in accordance with the invention having deployable ribbon elements 740 a, 740 b with barbs formed thereon to facilitate engagement with a hollow structure.

Not all choice is good. Even if the January strawberry tastes OK, even if you have a really good strawberry that\\'s organic, I still know you turned down other things for that to happen.\\nThat\\'s something I can do is try to make the menu, as much as I can, reflect a lot of the natural rhythms of this part of the world and reflect used to be the way you would eat before you could cheat.\\nAnd guess what? That\\'s what culinary tradition is, making the harvest season last all year long. My God, the most unique holiday we have is Thanksgiving, it should be something that if you really ponder what Thanksgiving is all about, you would really understand food. But people think it\\'s about gluttony, as opposed to truly revering this your great harvest celebration, and now put stuff up so you don\\'t starve over the winter. But people don\\'t think about it that way—here, it\\'s the beginning of the eating season.\\nVery interesting…I do agree that having all foods available all the time can make eating less pleasurable. For example, I never eat fresh apples out of hand…except for every fall, when I pounce on the Honeycrisps from Door County.\\nStill, I wonder about the practicality of eating seasonally and putting food up for winter. With a full time position in academia, a working spouse, and a toddler, I think I\\'m doing well to get anything homemade on the table most days. Would I love to can and preserve and put up those tomatoes from my garden, so that I have homemade sauces and local veggies all winter? Absolutely…and maybe someday I\\'ll get there. But in the meantime, I can\\'t promise that I\\'ll limit myself to root vegetables until next May in the name of eating locally.\\nI\\'m not saying this to argue Rodgers\\'s point, because I strongly believe in supporting the local farmer. I\\'d love to, however, tap the knowledge resources of everyone here–how DO we live sustainably in a time-crunched world?\\nI was just talking about this today on another board. I think so many people think of healthy eating as an \"all or nothing\" approach, and I think it\\'s not being \"sold\" the right way to the public. They hear \"This is bad for you, that is bad for you,\" they think \"There\\'s nothing left to eat! So they throw up their hands and grab whatever they see that looks and sounds good and is quick and easy (and cheap) or they drive through wherever is closest.\\nI think we have gotten so far off the path of what we are supposed to be eating as human beings that it\\'s just going to take gradual tweaking and tweaking and doing your best to make the right choices when and where you can. It\\'s not about being perfect and starting to can your own veggies or make your own jams as that\\'s not feasible for many of us (including apartment dwellers like me). However, my grocery cart in the checkout line today is nowhere near what it was 5 years ago, and is on a completely different planet from 10 years ago, but I know I\\'m still \"not there\" and I continue to tweak when and where I can. And I *enjoy* it. I don\\'t feel like it\\'s a chore. I like finding out that this product is better than that one or that I prefer this one to that one because their company or farm does things I approve of and the competitor product does not. It has made shopping enjoyable for me again instead of a chore.\\nThere\\'s a big misconception about scratch cooking=TIME and though I find her irritating, Rachael Ray is doing a great job of smashing that barrier for the \"average American\" (whatever that is). I think at the same time, despite the hard work of many like Ms. Rodgers, the whole \"seasonal\" thing is not being explained well or pushed out to the masses the right way. I keep thinking if we had someone like Rachael Ray who could show QUICK and SIMPLE and TASTY and INEXPENSIVE as well as SEASONAL, seasonal shoppers would help drive LOCAL by virtue of demand, instead of putting out the local produce (which I see even in the big chain groceries now, albeit in limited quantity/variety) and them buying what they\\'re used to buying because they always buy it and they don\\'t know what to do with radishes or parsnips or why tomatoes from less than 20 miles away are better and fresher than those trucked in from the other side of the country.\\nMaybe you can only make one thing and put it away for winter right now, and it\\'s a fun, family project that you do for Thanksgiving instead of everyone gorging as Rodgers points out, and then you enjoy it when those dark and cold days come in January and February and it feels like the winter will never end. And it makes you smile. And that\\'s what it\\'s about.\\nI have recently had a great deal of interest in learning to braise food. I am mastering that skill now, and I think I have done it well.At the same time I am learning what to do with celery root. It is amazing how many different types of food we see through the seasons that are maybe out of our normal paradigm of what we may or may not eat. This summer I learned how to grow and harvest fennel. Of course I can say that much of my interest in these things comes from the vast amount of reading I do. Whether it be on egullet, Food and Wine, Gourmet or a blog, a great deal of interest in food comes from what is out there in the media.\\nFind a reason to eat in season.\\nA lot of eating seasonally definitely revolves around techniques for cooking food that\\'s available at the time.\\nFall and Winter foods are certainly harder to cook, since you typically have to do something involved to the ingredients to make their flavors come out. This is a decidedly different approach to cooking than most Spring and Summer food, where you\\'re likely to get the best results by staying hands off and letting the ingredients speak for themselves.\\nAlso, I think there\\'s certainly a distinction between eating Chilean blueberries in February and eating commercially preserved blueberries (assuming they\\'re done in a way that\\'s reasonably healthy and natural). Nobody says you have to do all of the preservation work yourself.<|begin_of_text|>Lingual retainer\\nThe invention relates to a lingual retainer which can be connected at both ends to the teeth of a patient by means of an adhesive connection in order to maintain the position of the corrected teeth of the patient in said corrected position.

The appliance as defined in claim 2, wherein the bow has surface regions at and/or between its ends on that side of its surface which will face the teeth of a patient, which surface regions are roughened for the accommodation of a bonding agent.\\n19. The appliance as defined in claim 10, wherein the bow has surface regions at and/or between its ends on that side of its surface which will face the teeth of a patient, which surface regions are roughened for the accommodation of a bonding agent.\\nThis application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/EP03/10478, filed Sep. 19, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference.\\nThe invention relates to an orthodontic appliance in the form of a lingual retainer comprising a bow that can be attached at both ends to the teeth of a patient by means of a cement bond, in order to keep the patient\\'s teeth in position following corrective treatment.\\nThe purpose of lingual retainers is to keep teeth in a new, corrected position following orthodontic treatment and to stabilize this position. Lingual retainers are usually bonded to the teeth on the non-visible (lingual) surface thereof.\\nPrior art lingual retainers consist, for example, of a bow made of, say, a non-annealed Co/Cr alloy, as this alloy ensures that the brace is sufficiently pliable to enable the bonding regions to be positioned to fit well against the surface of the teeth. The bonding regions are produced by soldering so-called metal mesh pads of, e.g., stainless steel to the ends of the bow.\\nThe main disadvantages of this kind of lingual retainer comprise the use of different metals or alloys and the fact that the metal mesh pad is joined to the bow by soldering, as a result of which the resistance to corrosion or the biocompatibility of the retainer is substantially reduced. Furthermore, the bonding regions increase the overall thickness and reduce patient comfort.\\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide a lingual retainer showing good pliability and biocompatibility while avoiding the aforementioned material-dependent problems and affording enhanced patient comfort, thereby allowing it to be worn for prolonged periods (in extreme cases for a lifetime) without causing health-related side effects.\\nThis object is achieved, according to the invention, by fabricating a lingual retainer of the type defined above from a single material selected from the group consisting of titanium and titanium alloys.\\nRetainers of the present invention made from titanium or titanium alloys are highly biocompatible and can thus be used for very long periods of time without causing any adverse health-related side effects.\\nFurthermore, titanium or titanium alloys are materials that are of low rigidity (low modulus of elasticity), are pliable, having a low elastic limit, and can be readily bonded to teeth.\\nIn a variant of the retainer of the invention, the bow has a bonding region at each end thereof, by means of which it can be bonded in a simple and accurate manner to the patient\\'s teeth.\\nAlternatively, simple retainers can be used, these being composed of a bow only and often consisting of a (frequently multistrand) wire, the elastic limit of which is so low that it is pliable. These simple bows not equipped with bonding regions are bonded as such to the lingual surface of the teeth to be stabilized.\\nWithin the scope of the present invention, bonding is understood to mean any kind of connection that adhesively joins materials together. Specifically, a bond can be created using any of the standard cements employed in dentistry, particular examples of which for use in the present context are glasionomer cements.\\nThese retainers can also be specially prepared for bonding by providing them with specially prepared surface regions at the sites where they are to be bonded to the patient\\'s teeth. In the simplest case, these would be surface regions located at each end of the bow. This bow more preferably has on its side designed to face the surface of the teeth one or more additional surface regions prepared for bonding to teeth.\\nThe preparation of the surface region for bonding purposes may consist of roughening, for example. Roughening can be accomplished by etching, sandblasting, laser machining, or by mechanical machining, such as embossing or metal cutting.\\nThe retainer is preferably produced with its bow and the two bonding regions forming a unitary structure. If desired, the bonding regions may be adapted to provide an enlarged surface area for bonding the retainer to the teeth.\\nThe bow more preferably has substantially the same thickness as the bonding regions, and the transition between the bow and the bonding regions is such that the bow substantially merges with the bonding region or is attached thereto in flushed relationship. In this way the bonding regions do not increase the overall thickness, and patient comfort is enhanced.\\nWith respect to this requirement as well as to the need for the simplest possible manufacturing process, the retainer is preferably made from sheet metal, e.g., by stamping.\\nThe entire retainer, that is, the bow including the bonding regions at its ends, is thus stamped from the sheet metal, or else fabricated there from in some other way, so that the retainer has consistent thickness. The necessary residual rigidity is set by the occlusal-gingival dimension of the bow.\\nIn another preferred embodiment, the bow of the retainer is made from multi-strand wire. In this case, a plurality of wire filaments is stranded to form a wire. The individual filaments may be of the same or different types. Thus it will be a very simple matter for the person skilled in the art to produce retainers having the desired mechanical properties mentioned above, not only by varying the number of filaments used, but also by selecting them according to their mechanical strength values. In this regard, not only the diameter of the individual filaments, but also their composition, can be varied so that, for example, a number of filaments of various similar titanium alloys can be used. This meets the demand for biocompatibility forming one of the objectives of the invention.\\nAdvantageous retainers can be produced from half-round or half-oval profiled materials, and the surface regions required for bonding purposes can be formed on the flat side of the bow.\\nThis avoids the presence of projections and depressions on the retainer, which are detrimental to oral hygiene, and result, inter alia, in improved patient comfort, because the tongue, which can detect very small uneven regions, will only come into contact with a material that is substantially uniformly thick and thus smooth.\\nThe bonding regions are preferably roughened on the surface to be bonded.\\nVarious methods are recommended for roughening the relevant surfaces of the bonding regions, such as sandblasting, chemical etching or, in particular, laser structuring, that is, machining with a laser ray, as disclosed in EP 0 841 877 B1.\\nThe titanium or titanium alloy lingual retainers of the invention can be fabricated in particular as a unitary structure without involving soldering or the use of additional metal mesh pads or other supplementary materials, so that the high degree of biocompatibility of titanium and titanium alloys can by fully exploited.\\nAn advantage of titanium and titanium alloys is that they have a low modulus of elasticity, so that the lingual retainer itself will react with only a low restoring force to any possible deflection thereof by the tooth to be held in place. This is assisted by the pliability, i.e., the low elastic limit, of titanium and titanium alloys, which makes the shape of the bow readily adaptable to the topology of a patient\\'s mouth.\\nThe flat form, which is preferred, is easy to produce by manufacturing the lingual retainer from a titanium or titanium alloy sheet metal, e.g., by stamping or cutting.\\nIn the latter case especially, the bonding region is formed flush with the bow and is thus not made thicker by any soldered-on metal mesh pad.\\nThe previously mentioned method of laser structuring (EP 0 841 877 B1) creates an adequate number of retention sites, which is conducive to a lifelong, durable adhesive bond.\\nThese and other advantages of the invention are explained in greater detail below with reference to the drawings, in which:\\nFIG. 1: shows an initially unbent embodiment of a lingual retainer of the invention;\\nFIG. 2: shows another variant of the lingual retainer of the invention;\\nFIG. 3: is a diagrammatic representation of a lingual retainer of the invention attached to the lower jaw of a patient; and\\nFIG. 4: shows another embodiment of the lingual retainer of the invention.\\nFIG. 1 illustrates a lingual retainer made of, e.g., a titanium alloy, designated as a whole by the reference number 10. Lingual retainer 10 consists of a profiled bow 12 and two bonding regions 14, 16 formed one at each end thereof.\\nLingual retainer 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 is stamped from a titanium alloy sheet as a unitary structure, i.e., bonding regions 14 and 16 are integral with bow 12. Furthermore, lingual retainer 10 is of consistent thickness over its entire length, and this promotes oral hygiene and, since there are no recesses or protuberances which could disturb the tongue, enhances the patient comfort.\\nBonding regions 14 and 16 are roughened on their surfaces 18 and 20 respectively in preparation for bonding the same to a patient\\'s tooth, said roughening being in the form of a grid-like laser structure. It is therefore not necessary to solder on a metal mesh pad, as otherwise necessary, which is not only an advantage with regard to the biocompatibility of the lingual retainer of the invention, but also reduces the number of production steps, since laser structuring is much easier to accomplish and is more economical. Furthermore, corrosion problems are avoided, since the incorporation of additional materials other than titanium or titanium alloys is no longer necessary due to the type of bonding surface 18 or 20 used.\\nAlternatively, bonding surfaces 18, 20 may be sandblasted or chemically etched, in which case it is only necessary to ensure that the surface is adequately roughened with, in particular, undercutting thereof, which will ensure secure anchorage of the cement to the bonding regions 18 and 20.\\nFIG. 2 illustrates another variant of a lingual retainer 30 of the invention, which is composed of a bow 32 and two bonding regions 34, 36. In this embodiment, the bow 32 is welded to the separately manufactured bonding regions, e.g., by laser welding.\\nBow 32 is anatomically pre-formed so that the dentist merely has to make slight additional corrections to the shape of the bent bow 32 before placing it in the mouth of a patient and cementing it to the patient\\'s teeth.\\nThe bonding regions 34, 36 have a bonding surface 38 and 40 respectively, which is again laser structured, as described above in connection with FIG. 1.\\nFIG. 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a typical attachment situation involving a lingual retainer, for example a lingual retainer 50 comprising a bow 54 and bonding regions 56, 58 formed thereon.\\nBonding regions 56, 58 are bonded to the lingual side of, say, the cuspids of the lower jaw 52 of a patient by a cement bond and they maintain said cuspids, as well as the incisors located between them, in the position attained by previous corrective treatment using some other orthodontic device.\\nFIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a retainer 60 of the invention made from a profiled titanium material having a half-round cross section. Unlike the retainers illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 3, the lingual retainer 60 has no enlarged region on the ends 62, 63 of its brace 64 for bonding to the surfaces of the teeth, but instead the surface regions 66, 67 are confined to the flat surface of the half-round profile.\\nFIG. 4 further illustrates that the lingual retainers of the invention may also preferably have surface regions 68 along their bow at intervals corresponding to the positions of the teeth, which surface regions supplement the surface regions 66 and 67, so that this lingual retainer 60 can, if required, be adhesively attached to each of the teeth supported by bow 64.\\nPrevious Patent: Dental implant system and method for effecting a dental restoration using the same\\nNext Patent: System and method for detecting dental caries<|begin_of_text|>Seats and Chairs\\n6029 Luce Ave SE 49302 Alto, Michigan\\nHome About Us Contact Us Wish List (0) My Account Checkout\\nSeatsAndChairs.com | Where Your Home Theater Begins! | 1-800-632-7657\\nNew Movie Theater Chairs\\nUsed Movie Theater Chairs\\nCommercial Grade Power Movie Theater Recliner\\nLeather Seating (3)\\nClassic Theater Seating (3)\\nStackable Chairs\\nInstallation & Removal Services\\nRefurbishing Services\\new Buy Chairs\\nHome Theater Resources\\nSeats and Chairs Videos\\nSeats and Chairs Return Policy\\nTypical Shipping Costs\\nHome » News/Blog Headlines » Seven of the Best Movie Theaters in the World\\nSeven of the Best Movie Theaters in the World\\nIf you\\'re like us, you probably enjoy most of your movies at home. But sometimes; there are movies that are so good, so awe-inspiring, and so epic that you want to enjoy them where they\\'re supposed to be watched: in the cold, dark confines of a movie theater with a giant tub of popcorn in hand, and a jumbo-sized drink in your seat\\'s cup holder. Some movies are just worth getting in the car to drive to the theater, and stand in line to buy a ticket just to see it once. Or twice. Or seven times.\\nTo be fair, it\\'s not always the movie. The movie theaters themselves can be so awesome and so epic as to be worth the hassle just to get there, no matter what movie they\\'re playing. And no, we\\'re not talking about 4D or other newfangled types of sound and picture processing technology. We\\'re talking about an incredible theater experience that will make you feel like coming back for more. Here is our list of seven of the best movie theaters ever:\\nThe Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas – First opened in 1997, the Alamo Drafthouse can now be found in 22 different locations in the US. It is famous for being among the first theaters to adopt a more classy movie-watching experience by offering comfortable seating, drinks, and food that you might find in an upscale, fine dining restaurant.\\nThe Cine-de Chef in Kathmandu, Nepal – This theater\\'s claim to fame is its level of luxury, with its expensive ticket prices, plush leather chairs, and gourmet food prepared by a chef. Cine-de Chef also boasts of having another branch in Seoul, South Korea.\\nThe Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, New York – Williamsburg in Brooklyn is where you\\'ll need to go to find this unique venue with three screens where; aside from a movie, you can partake of a global menu and craft cocktails that are served straight to your luxury seat.\\nThe Electric Cinema in London, England – To say that this movie theater; found in London\\'s Notting Hill Area, is quite posh is an understatement. Watch a movie while relaxing in large, comfy seats with footstools and cashmere blankets; or on beds (yes, beds) located at the front of the screen. Enjoy a bottle of wine, or have some Camden Ale while munching on Carrot Cake, Nachos, or a big portion of Chicken Bites. You can also have drinks at the full bar; and have an after-movie meal at its Electric Diner. Posh, indeed.\\nThe Cinémathèque Française in Paris – When is a movie theater more than just a place to watch films? When it\\'s also a museum (partially, anyway)!The museum part of the theater boasts an impressive collection of film memorabilia: from historical items such as camera obscura, magic lanterns, and optic boxes from the past; as well as posters, costumes, and props such as the classic female robot used in Fritz Lang\\'s film Metropolis. Designed by architect Franck Gehry, the theater shows films from all over the world, and sometimes screens classic films of cinematic legends.\\nThe Raj Mandir Cinema in Jaipur, India – This movie theater gets special mention for its grand interiors and palatial design: balcony viewing areas, impressive high ceiling decked with chandeliers, carpets, and elaborate carvings make this venue feel more like a tourist spot than a theater. The Raj Mandir is one of the oldest movie theaters is India, having been built in 1976, and is a popular site for movie premieres of Hindi films. Watch the movie on an extra-large screen while enjoying Samosas, and bask in the theater\\'s incredible history.\\nThe TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California – No discussion of movie theaters would be complete without including the TCL Chinese Theatre. Known to people by its more popular names; as the Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre, and then as the Mann\\'s Chinese Theatre, the TCL Chinese Theatre is an important part of movie history. Famous for its Hollywood Walk of Fame where you can find the foot and hand prints of your favorite stars; the TLC Chinese Theatre also features a guided tour, or you can just take in a movie showing on the theater\\'s massive screen.\\nCreate your own unforgettable movie experience by watching films in your very own Home Theater.

Wade / Casey OVERTURNED. What\\'s the Effect on Employers and Health Plans?\\nLisa Nelson June 24, 2022, 8:25 am August 1, 2022 Comments Off on Roe v. Wade / Casey OVERTURNED. What\\'s the Effect on Employers and Health Plans?\\nUpdate June 24, 2022\\nThis morning, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) found in favor of the state of Mississippi in the Dobbs case (cited in detail below). In doing so, SCOTUS also overturned prior SCOTUS decisions in Roe (1973) and Casey (1992), effectively banning abortive care in states where there exists pre-Roe and \"trigger\" bans of abortion. Trigger bans are where state law already bans access, in some degree, to abortive care should Roe be overturned. Since Roe was overturned in the Dobbs decision, it is up to each state to determine access to abortive care in their state. To-date, states with such bans potentially effective upon the overturning of Roe based on pre-Roe laws or pre-decision state action include: AL, AZ, AK, GA, ID, IA, KY, LA, MI, MS, MO, ND, OH, OK, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, WV, WI and WY. Of which OK, NE, SD, TX and LA are immediate and others within 30 days or upon state decision on how to handle pre-Roe laws still on the books that ban abortive care. Four other states have indicated they too will impose restrictions to abortive care access in some form, including: FL, IN, MT and NE. Conversely, the following states have or plan to take action to ensure continued access to abortive care: CA, CO, CT, DE. HA, IL, ME, MD, MA, NV, NJ, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA and the District of Columbia.\\nThe specific questions posed to SCOTUS in the Dobbs case were:\\n1. Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.\\n2. Whether the validity of a pre-viability law that protects women\\'s health, the dignity of unborn children, and the integrity of the medical profession and society should be analyzed under Casey\\'s \"undue burden\" standard or Hellerstedt\\'s balancing of benefits and burdens.\\n3. Whether abortion providers have third-party standing to invalidate a law that protects women\\'s health from the dangers of late-term abortions.\\nJustice Alito drafted the 6-3 opinion (which was virtually identical to the leaked draft opinion in May), with Chief Justice agreeing with the decision in favor of Mississippi but not that the decision needed to overturn Roe / Casey. Breyer, Sotomayer and Kagan dissented. Justice Thomas stated that this decision could be broader than the abortion issue, whereas Alito stated this decision should only apply to the issue of abortion. Ultimately, the Court found that abortion is not protected as a \"liberty\" under the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause since it is not steeped in the traditions and history of this nation. You may view the decision by the Court – 19-1392 Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization (06/24/2022) (supremecourt.gov)\\nHeld: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives. Pp. 8–79.\\nEmployers and health plan sponsors wishing to take action following this decision are encouraged to speak with their legal or compliance professional before taking any action to ensure compliance with applicable law. It is also important to avoid potentially harmful communications with employees who maintain opinions vastly different than the organization\\'s.\\nLeavitt Group has been on top of this issue for our clients and can offer support regardless of the position they may have on the issue, including analyzing the compliance challenges that may come with adopting certain policies or plan designs in response to the Dobbs decision. Be sure to contact your Leavitt Group representative. See below for full details on the cases cited herein and the impact of the decision on employers and health plans, including important questions to ask and considerations to think about.\\nOriginal article published May 9, 2022, after the leak of the draft opinion for the Dobbs Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) case. See below for full details on this case and it\\'s impact on employers and health plans.\\n\"May Day\" brought more than the start of a new month. News source Politico published a bombshell report that the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) draft decision (titled \"1st Draft\" of the \"Opinion of the Court\") in the Mississippi (MS) case (Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization) challenging the legality of a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. [SCOTUS Oral Arguments 12/1/21 Audio/Transcript.] In Dobbs, MS asked SCOTUS to overturn both Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), to eliminate the federal right to abortion, and in Casey, the right to be free from undue burden in exercising the right to abortion before fetal viability. [See for other unrelated laws overturned in recent years, indicating that this SCOTUS bench has a panache for doing so.]\\n\"First, picking up [where]… you just left off, Justice Barrett, on safe haven laws, the Respondents in this case, [I]… believe, as Your Honor pointed out, have emphasized parenting burdens being a lead or the lead reason that women seek abortions. I would emphasize safe haven laws, as best I\\'ve been able to find, first came into existence in 1999 in Texas. They\\'re now ubiquitous, and you\\'re correct, Justice Barrett, that they relieve that huge burden. I would also add that as to — as to burdens during pregnancy, I would emphasize that contraception is more accessible and affordable and available than it was at the time of Roe or Casey. It serves the same goal of allowing women to decide if, when, and how many children to have.\" – Oral Arguments in favor of MS for overturning Roe and Casey.\\nCourt Reasoning\\nJustice Alito (appointed by W. Bush) writes the opinion of the court, which indicates it may be a decision leaning in favor of MS. With the majority of the bench appointed by Republican Presidents, and both assumed and witnessed in prior decisions, generally, to lean conservative and pro-life, the 6-3 draft decision shows all of those Republican-appointed Justices deciding to overturn Roe and Casey, with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kegan the dissents (notably, Democrat-appointed Justices). The shift from more liberal to \"conservative\" (a comment generally used but not accurate, conservatives can also be pro-choice, etc.) is noticeable and remarked upon by Justice Sotomayor – \"The newest ban that Mississippi has put in place, the six-week ban, the Senate sponsors said we\\'re doing it [challenging Roe & Casey now] because we have new justices on the Supreme Court.\"\\n\"Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,\" the draft opinion states.\\nOf course, a document labeled a \"1st Draft\" means this opinion and, hence, the decision itself, could change between now and the anticipated release date of the actual decision. Expected in June. Likely June 27th, the last day of the term usually reserved for the most controversial case decisions.\\nAlito\\'s draft decision of the court argues that rights protected by the Constitution, but not explicitly mentioned in it (unenumerated rights) must be strongly rooted in U.S. history and tradition.\\n\"I think that that is part of it, yes. And I think, for many women, that is an incredibly difficult choice, but it\\'s one that this Court for 50 years has recognized must be left up to them based on their beliefs and their conscience and their determination about what is best for the course of their lives.\" – Oral Arguments for in favor of the Plaintiff seeking to overturn restrictive Mississippi abortion law.\\nImpact of Overturning of Roe & Casey on Insurance Landscape\\nInsured health plans would be subject to state mandates, while self-funded plans are exempt from most state insurance mandates per ERISA. (See Guttmacher Institute research on state laws related to reproductive health). The insurance landscape is already inconsistent, and that is with Roe & Casey intact. Insurance coverage of abortive care is mandated in only six states (CA, NY, IL, ME, OR, WA). The number of other states with some level of abortive care restrictions ranges from 22 to 26 and growing. (See Guttmacher Institute State Policy Research). If the SCOTUS decision indeed overturns Roe and Casey, those states will have restrictions or bans in force immediately.\\nEffect on Health Plans\\nInsured plans will be subject to a state law banning coverage, performing and being a patient to an abortion. In states with bans or restriction on abortive care, some employers are considering policies and programs to assist in facilitation and paying for abortive care in a state where abortions are legal.\\nSelf-funded plans are not affected by state laws (they are regulated by ERISA, a federal law the preempt state law and permits, mostly, large employers to set their own policies) banning abortive coverage, with the exception of states that criminalize facilitating abortive care. Even then, some states are trying to get ahead of that threat by enacting their own laws protecting those from abortion facilitation liabilities. The outcome of battling the state laws will no doubt end up in court.\\n\\u200bPaying for Abortive Care\\nEmployer Considerations for Funding Abortive Care Through Health Plans or Otherwise\\nMulti-state employers will have to analyze their plans\\' rights and obligations by considering the following:\\nIs the plan self-funded (or level) or fully insured?\\nSelf/level-funded plans will generally not be subject to the ban and can offer health plan coverage or reimbursement for travel to a state that provides abortive care.\\nThis is presumptuous. The IRS may remove the tax write off for travel for abortive purposes. A tax write-off may still be available for health coverage.\\nWould out-of-state abortion for a self-funded plan in a different state be out-of-network? How will it be billed? Will state taxation apply in the state banning abortions? All these questions will need answering and cannot be know at this stage.\\nWhich state is your business situs?\\n16 states and the D.C., have laws that protect access to abortive care, with CO, NJ and WA joining the list just this year.\\nA response to overturning Roe could equally affect red states that are, generally, passing legislation to ban or restrict abortion, and blue states passing similar laws as the 16 above (as of May 3, 2022) to protect the right to abortion and freedom from undue burden in exercising the Roe right pre-viability.\\nDoes your state prohibit facilitation of abortive care, like Texas?\\nDo you have employees on TRICARE or Medicaid?\\nHyde Amendment would result in these employees not having access to abortive care, like self-funded plan members or insured plan members in states protecting the right to abortive care.\\nConsider whether to offer an option for those employees via one of the methods discussed below.\\nSome states will use state funded Medicaid to finance abortive care for those without access (CA, HA, IL, ME, MD, NY, OR, & WA).\\nDo you have employees on the Affordable Care Act\\'s state Exchange Marketplace (e.g., Covered California)?\\n25 states restrict insurance coverage even in private insurance plans, including those through the Exchange.\\nConsider if you would want a policy to address the need for these employees.\\nAre you a public employer?\\n22 states restrict coverage for public employees.\\nExchange Marketplace, TRICARE, Medicare & Medicaid Funding of Abortive Care is Prohibited\\nThe Hyde Amendment prohibits use of federal funds for abortion regardless of the status of Roe, Casey & state law (exceptions for rape, incest, and endangerment of mother\\'s health). The issue of who will pay for abortions will become more complex should SCOTUS overturn Roe, sending the decision as to legality of abortion each state. (Roe became law in 1972 intending to remove the states\\' patchwork of rights to abortive care and privacy in reproductive health and birth control.)\\nPaying for Travel for Abortive Care\\nMany large employers have expressed their intention (or already have installed such policy in response to the Texas law enacted in 2021) to reimburse U.S. employees (and eligible dependents in some cases) up to $4,000 in travel expenses (e.g., Match, Salesforce, Uber/Lyft, Amazon, Google, Levi Strauss, Bumble, Citigroup, and Yelp to name a few). Per the Internal Revenue Code section 213, travel and lodging are reimbursable medical expenses. The IRC is ruled by the federal government. Whether the feds will allow reimbursement of such travel expenses to receive what a state may deem illegal could have unintended consequences for which it is too soon to identify and speculate.\\nFor example – The IRS does not permit tax-free coverage of state-registered domestic partners mandated to be offered employer-sponsored health coverage the same as a spouse. While the state will not tax that coverage, the IRS does! Will the IRS do the same with IRC 213? Prohibit tax-free travel for what is deemed illegal in the resident state? Or, will only state taxation be impacted? Federal law will not define \"medical expenses\" to consider state law legal medical procedures? Only time will tell. Be sure you are signed up for the Leavitt Group news alerts so that you will be informed of changes in the law affecting your health plans and eligibility for tax free travel expenses for purposes of abortive care.\\nEmployer Options for Self-funded Plan Coverage of Out-of-State Abortive Care Travel\\nPathways and considerations that complicate a policy of offering financial and/or facilitation costs for abortive care include:\\nGross-up salary to avoid all health plan or medical expense rules.\\nThis option would tax the employee and is complicated by issues related to accruing other benefits related to income and inconsistent application of policies that could appear discriminatory.\\nProvide a reimbursement through a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or other self-funded plan.\\nNondiscrimination testing would still apply.\\nIf the IRS redefines medical expense for purposes of tax-free IRC 213 reimbursements to consider legality of the procedure, this may complicate this option.\\nOne-time bonus for the travel and cost of procedure in a state permitting abortive care.\\nThis option will result in a higher taxation that a gross up and could present the same appearance of inconsistency or discrimination.\\nIf the self-funded plan decides to run all procedure and travel costs through the plan, as any other medical expenses, they will still need to define the benefit.\\nQuestions to answer when defining an abortive care benefit include:\\nWhat are the limits, terms, etc.?\\nIf using an HRA model, what would reimbursement look like?\\nAre you setting up an entire new HRA just for these purposes?\\nWill it be integrated with an ACA-compliant health plan?\\nAre plan documents and other health plan compliance measures considered?\\nWill COBRA need to be offered?\\nRecent State Actions Related to Abortive Care\\nRecently, the Missouri legislature and the 2021 Texas law made it a civil crime for any person assisting the pregnant woman with travel to receive an abortion. This means, employers could potentially face liability for facilitating travel to another state via providing the travel funds or health plan coverage to provide abortive care. But states are in a battle to either protect your rights one way or another, depending on which side you lean.\\nIn response to restrictive state laws in Texas, Missouri, and Mississippi and in response to the Dobbs, some states are taking action to make their statement as to the legality of abortion in that state if Roe and Casey were to be overturned. In California, SB 1142 (which will be addressed in the appropriations committee on May 9) is a measure that would provide funding for out-of-state residents who may travel there for abortive care. Additionally, California legislature is working on a bill that would protect those who facilitate travel to the state for such care. How the courts will handle the imminent legal challenges is impossible to know while all these measures are still being considered. (Connecticut has a similar law to California also working its way through legislature.)\\nMeanwhile, in Florida, the No Tax Breaks for Radical Corporate Activism Act will prohibit employers from reimbursing or paying directly for travel expenses to go out-of-state to receive abortive care.\\n\"Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?\" – Justice Sotomayor\\nEverything is speculative until the decision is formally released. Any forecasting of laws to come, effects of current, often-times antiquated laws, and even the outcome of the SCOTUS decision in Mississippi, is speculative. Overturning Roe and Casey will undoubtedly have earthquake effects across many components of our lives, including employer policy, taxation, health care, mother and infant mortality, economics of many women and social dialogue.\\nRegardless, compliance on. Regardless of which position an employer will take, it is important to consider the many compliance laws that will come into play when putting in place any benefits or tax-benefited programs. Communication with your employees and doing so with sensitivity cannot be overdone. It can save a lot of headaches. Many laws will include a notice provision!\\nConsider communicating with sensitivity. When discussing a sensitive topic like abortion, there is indeed the likelihood someone could get offended or have strong opinions. Try to be matter of fact rather than having an opinion or making a prediction as if it is a known thing. For example, instead of saying \"The injustice of Roe will be overturned.\" Consider \"SCOTUS draft opinion/opinion overturned Roe.\" Or, \"To afford employees continued access to abortive care, XYZ is available.\" Not, \"To allow employees to exercise their right to abortions….\" It may be worth getting ahead of the conversation with your employee population if you have a demographic where this may cause some rumblings in the workforce. This is early yet. There is a lot to be known and decisions yet to be made. Patience while preparing is always a sound approach. Let us know how we can help!\\nNeed help?

While many mainstream Indian leaders hailed the decision as historic for the territorial integrity of India but many Kashmiri Muslims feel betrayed and cheated and are wondering if they made a historic blunder by rejecting the two-nation theory. It is unfortunate that a nation that once fought so vigorously against British attempt to divide its provinces such as Bengal on religious lines is playing the same evil game with its own people who have allegedly lost faith in it due to incessant betrayals ranging from deliberate rigging of elections to toppling of democratically elected governments. In the words of an eminent academician PB Mehta– \"Even if Article 370 were to be scrapped, the proposal to alter Jammu and Kashmir\\'s status to Union Territory, even if temporarily, is designed to humiliate an already subjugated population. How dare a Muslim dominated state exists in India? Kashmir can now not even be trusted to be a state. The optics of this measure is not integration, it is humiliation, of a piece with subtle and unsubtle reminders to minorities of their place in India.\"\\nSince the authorities at whose behest all this was done constitute the government of India, they have done not only an irreparable damage to the honor of this republic but have also portrayed it as a nation that relishes in breaking promises made to its own people. All this should not come as a surprise given that the people who took this drastic decision come from a class of Hindu Upper Castes who have been historically adept at taking decisions ill-intentioned at best and inegalitarian at worst. Though these bloodline based cliche castes constitute only 10-15% of the Indian population but have been dominating and exploiting the riches of the sub-continent since long by manipulating public opinion using vicious tactics of communal hatred, Islamophobia, jingoism, etc and through their cowardly hate speeches bring shame and disrepute to the whole nation. If one were to analyse the forces behind all controversial, insensitive and communal decisions taken in India over the last two centuries, almost all would invariably come out to have been taken or engineered by someone from this rigidly over-pampered and notorious tiny class. (to have a better understanding of their historic injustices, one is advised to read the writings of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar). And now they have wreaked havoc on Kashmir. They seem to forget that while governments come and go but certain injustices have tendencies to torn apart nations.\\nThe genesis of the Kashmir Dispute-\\nIndia got independence from British rule in 1947 but unfortunately was partitioned into two nations namely India and Pakistan. Under the partition plan, Hindu majority areas of British India were to constitute India and the Muslim majority areas were to constitute Pakistan. Hundreds of princely states of the subcontinent were given the choice of either acceding to any of these two dominions or remain independent but were advised to keep in mind their people\\'s wishes and geographical circumstances. Kashmir was a Muslim majority state, (as per 1941 census) but it had a Hindu Upper Caste Maharaja who initially wanted to remain independent. But sensing a pro-India tilt in the ruler\\'s attitude, Pakistan allegedly staged an invasion by tribal militias who soon captured vast territories which are now termed as Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The panic-stricken King asked for India\\'s help which assured him of military help but on the condition that he accede to the Indian dominion. After he agreed, Indian troops were hurriedly air-lifted to the province and the fall of the capital Srinagar was prevented but skirmishes between Indian forces and Pakistan backed militias continued for few months until India sought the intervention of United Nations.\\nA resolution (47) dated 21 April 1948 passed by UN Commission for India and Pakistan called for immediate ceasefire and demilitarization of the province so that a plebiscite might take place to determine the will of Kashmiri people. The withdrawal of the forces by both sides however never happened and nor the plebiscite because India wanted an asymmetric withdrawal of forces under which Pakistan had to withdraw first on the reason that it was an aggressor. Pakistan did not agree to this and demanded a parity in treatment which of course was rejected by India.\\nSince then various proposals by subsequent UN supervisors including those by McNaughton and Dixon have been rejected by India and Pakistan under various excuses. Quite ironically India also abhors proposals of arbitration and mediation in this dispute even though it endorses arbitration as a method for settlement of all international disputes in its constitution (Article 51). After imprisoning Sheikh Abdullah (the Prime Minister of Kashmir) in 1953, Indian government fortified the Kashmir Valley to an extent that today it has become the most militarized zone in the world with its streets being under the constant vigil of the armed forces. India Government also equipped its armed forces with such vast and draconian powers (under different legislations like AFSPA etc) not exercised even by the British Army stationed in India during the colonial rule. There have also been allegations by Kashmiri watchdogs that India has deliberately rigged elections in Kashmir and by doing so has denied Kashmiris their democratic rights.\\nOfficial flag of the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir under India\\nThough Kashmir was allowed until now to have its own constitution and flag but the constant intervention by the Central government in the legislative affairs of Jammu and Kashmir is no hidden fact. Time and again State governments in Kashmir have been dismissed at whims and fancies of the central government under varied excuses. Re-elections for the dissolved assemblies have also been delayed for a prolonged time. And now it has been made a Union Territory and will be governed directly by the central government in which Kashmiris will have little say if no say. One should wonder if such a system is unable to work in NCT of Delhi (where there is a face-off between the legislature and Central Government almost on a daily basis) then how it will work in Kashmir where public opinion is already beset with disaffection.\\nWhether there exists demand of self-determination in Kashmir?\\nThere is no doubt that since 1947, Kashmir has been embroiled in a great unrest with hundreds of civilians and insurgents getting killed annually during face-off with the armed forces stationed there. Separatist movements have also been active in the Kashmir Valley since long and as per official estimates, violence emanating from these movements has killed thousands of individuals. The recent suicide attack in Pulwama which killed over 50 military personals was one amongst series of other such events showing that all is not well in Kashmir as has been claimed by successive governments. Many popular Indian leaders like Jaiprakash Narayan have openly acknowledged the Valley\\'s disaffection towards India. In the words of Jaiprakash Narayan–\\n\"From all the information I have, 95 percent of Kashmir Muslims do not wish to be or remain Indian citizens. I doubt therefore the wisdom of trying to keep people by force where they do not wish to stay. This cannot but have serious long-term political consequences, though immediately it may suit policy and please public opinion.\"\\nQuite recently even the Indian Governor of Kashmir Satyapal Malik acknowledged that Kashmiris have lost faith in the democratic process as elections in Kashmir have been rigged. Apart from this, various reports of the UN and Human Rights Commissions on forced disappearances, mass executions, rapes and abuses in Kashmir lay bare the claims of normalcy. All these facts strengthen the argument that there is a demand for self-determination in Kashmir through its intensity and scope cannot be ascertained in absence of wider polls to that effect. Moreover, Kashmir has been promised plebiscite by none other than the United Nations.\\nWhether Kashmir satisfies the parameters of self-determination under International Law?\\nSelf-determination under International law has become a contentious issue these days with great difference between the written law and the practices of the states. Whereas various international agreements and conventions including UN Charter, ICCPR and ICESCR recognise the right to self determination as an invaluable right but in practice states have rarely honoured this commitment on their sweet will and generally frown upon any attempt of self-determination especially external self-determination (also known as extreme/violent self-determination) by any entity under their effective control and dominance. Various international charters and conventions talk about the right of self-determination and recognized it as a customary norm like right erga omnes (right owed to all). Article 1 of the UN Charter envisages Self-Determination as an objective of the United Nations for the strengthening World Peace. Several resolutions of UN including Resolution 1514 of 1960 and Friendly Relations Declarations of 1970 uphold the right of self-determination of people. Friendly Relations Declaration has by far been the most comprehensive articulation of the concept of Self-Determination and casts a positive obligation on every state to promote the principle of self-determination of people. It also casts a negative obligation on every state to refrain from those actions which deprive the people of their right to Self-Determination and freedom. Similarly, two other important international conventions namely ICCPR and ICESCR also talk about this right and provide that all people have the right to self-determination and states which are parties to the covenant have a duty to promote it. Though India is a party to these covenants, it made certain reservations and upheld self-determination only in the decolonization paradigm and also declared that it supports the self-determination of only those people who are under foreign domination and not of a section of people living under sovereign independent states. It is believed that India made these reservations keeping in mind the various secessionist movements on its own soil and especially with regards to the Kashmir issue.\\nSubjective and Objective analysis- This provides that a group to constitute people must subjectively feel that it is different from the rest of the inhabitants of the mother state and it should also satisfy the objective criteria of uniqueness in terms of its territory, ethnicity, language, culture, language, religion, etc. As is evident from various reports and studies, majority of Kashmiris do feel subjectively different from the rest of India and uniqueness of Kashmir has been recognized officially by the Indian government so much so that Kashmir was allowed until now to have a separate constitution and flag and given greater autonomy than other Indian states. Objectively also the uniqueness of Kashmir in terms of its territory (mountainous terrain), ethnicity (Kashmiri), language (Kashmiri), culture (Kashmiri), religion (pre-dominantly Muslim) is not a disputed fact. Therefore Kashmiris can be said to be fulfilling the subjective and objective criterion of people who can exercise the right to self-determination.\\nDecolonization Perspective– Under International law demand of self-determination is justified only in the case of decolonization paradigm and in some cases delayed decolonization paradigm. To prove that India is a colonizing power in Kashmir is a difficult task and more so when Kashmiris enjoy same rights and liabilities as rest of the Indians under the law of the land notwithstanding ground realities. Though it is widely believed that Kashmiris don\\'t want to remain in India or that they want to join Pakistan but in absence of any polling, plebiscite or referendum to that effect it is difficult to ascertain the opinion of the majority. However, there is no denying that many Kashmiris regard India as an occupying force and same can be witnesses in the daily strikes, hartals, bundhs, anti-India sloganeering and stone-pelting on Indian forces stationed in Kashmir all of which has become a routine affair now. Another important fact that raises eyebrows is the deployment of over 600000 Indian Military personals in Kashmir with vast draconian powers. Had public opinion in Kashmir been affectionate towards India, it would not have resorted to these extreme steps and excessive measures.\\nTerritorial Integrity- Uti Possidetis is a Just Cozens norm in International law and countries value their territorial integrity more than anything else but the moot question here is can a country make the argument of territorial integrity regarding a internationally disputed territory. Can all questions regarding the other most important Just Cozens norms like Human rights, civil and political liberty be shunted off by the mere claim of Uti-Possidetis? This certainly is not in tune with the spirit of United Nations and various International covenants including ICCPR and ICESCR that majestically uphold the cherished principles of Universal civil and political rights in accordance with the principles of Human Rights and the will of the people. Kashmir is undoubtedly a disputed territory under the annuls of International law and neither India nor Pakistan can ward off the question of its self-determination by the arguments of Uti-Possidetis or territorial integrity. Also, it seems too farcical to claim in this modern liberal and post-modern world that Uti-Possidetis is above Human Rights.\\nWhether there exists any possibility of the exercise of the right of self-determination in Kashmir?\\nNow with the abrogation of the special status and internal autonomy of India held Kashmir, there is little hope of anything of that sort happening in the current scenario given that India has time and again refused to budge on its stand that Kashmir is its integral part. And its a ravishing truth of the world history that smaller and weaker political entities under a more powerful and colossal polity have been rarely allowed to secede or broke away from the latter unilaterally even if the latter has been established to be an occupying force. It has also been observed that in many such scenarios, International law fails and hardcore realism takes over the mantle of the International Order as has been seen in the secessionist movements in powerful nations like Russia and China where they have been brutally suppressed and the world community could do little except raising eyebrows. India is also a growing economic and military power with a majoritarian government whose realist and jingoist tendencies are on ascendance and in such scenario there is little hope that it will deal benevolently with those Kashmiris who are disaffectionate towards it. Therefore any attempt by Kashmiris which is perceived hostile by the ruling dispensation would necessarily be rendered futile unless there is a drastic change in the sociopolitical structure of the sub-continent or of Kashmir.\\nUndoubtedly, it is one of the biggest ironies and hypocrisies of the 20th century that some people who had fought for their freedom with so much fanfare and dramebaazi spared no time in playing with Kashmir\\'s freedom, unity and dignity once they had purchased their own from their colonial masters. Kashmir deserves better and not just Kashmir, the whole subcontinent needs freedom from rampant socio-economic injustice, subordination, discrimination, exploitation, and corruption and slavery of a few elite castes and classes who have since long held hostage its resources and have mercilessly trampled upon the rights and dignity of others. But given that external self-determination is rarely successful in international arena and almost impossible without the consent of the mother entity that is powerful and brutal, Kashmiris should rather try to secure an effective internal self-determination within the current constitutional framework that benefits all other stakeholders of this dispute rather than making it a zero-sum game. Fragmentation or Balkanisation of this majestic sub-continent will only lead to interference from other foreign powers who can prove more pernicious and hostile as can be witnessed in Afghanistan and the Middle East. They should keep in mind that historically the Indian sub-continent has always clamoured for consolidation under one powerful entity for stability, power, fame, and prosperity. Whenever there has been division, disunity, and discord, it has plunged into deep crisis and a third power has taken the advantage and given nightmares to everyone as was the case during the British occupation. Hence Kashmir or any other entity of the subcontinent with secessionist ambitions should reflect deeply on the totality of circumstances and their viability as an independent nation before taking any extreme step. They should rather try to secure their rights and dignity within the current constitutional dynamics of the sub-continent by collaborating and cooperating with other affected groups and by collectively asserting control over the central authority in case they dislike the ruling dispensation. And in a vast subcontinent like this which is full of great diversity, they would definitely find a lot of sympathisers and hoards of people on their sides if they honestly try and persevere to march together for collective justice and not for fulfillment of narrow self-interests. And this would be much easier for them than seeking clandestine ways to secede and run away from positions of power and responsibility and then plunge into chaos and perpetual conflict. By choosing the narrower approach, they would be achieving no independence but on the contrary inviting other pernicious powers to interfere and meddle into the sub-continental affairs and squeeze its riches, honor, and dignity. And this a time tested old saying that \"United we stand and divided we fall.\"\\nAs for those who are mad under the inebriating influence of stately/regal power, they should know that this world is but an illusion and is ephemeral as is evident in the demise of one of their own former minister who was so desperate to see this Kashmir moment. And that they shall be held accountable for whatever they do either in this world or in the hereafter or in both- God knows the best. And that there is a difference between the justice of fallible man and that of the infallible Almighty who is all knowing, ever watchful and swift in reckoning.\\nBlameworthy are those who oppress people and tyrannize upon the land without right. They will have a painful punishment.\\nAl-Quran 42:42\\nPeace!🌹\\nNOTE:- Dear all, before commenting on this issue and other posts, please read our Disclaimer, Community Engagement Terms & Comment Guidelines to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding.\\nLIKE THIS?

First and foremost India came into the present form or rather in the larger form many times in its very long history. J&K was part of that ancient India many times. After independence, many of the states of present-day India had to be brought in the union against the will of Rajas/Nawabs. J&K, on the other hand, came willingly and peacefully, till self-proclaimed leader of Muslims, Pakistan intruded and brought catastrophe to the region. Giving J&K a religious color is absurd. From that logic, Kashmiris have been Shaivites all their life barring last thousand years or so. In fact, that is one reason their demeanor has always been very different from the rest of the Muslim world. Indian central leadership has done many mistakes in the past but J&K leadership is equally responsible for the present-day status. No one has till to date asked Yasin Malik that how does his wife live such a lavish life when he has no declared source of income.\\nI think this is the best chance populace of J&K got in the last 72 years to bring the state to normalcy rather than getting hoodwinked by Pak Army, who would be struggling to maintain their livelihood if Kashmir cause dies down. Time has come for Pakistani populace to stand up against Paki Army, which has brought the country at the brink of bankruptcy and international isolation.\\nThis my point of view and I believe in inclusive politics rather than absolutism.\\ninsightful.co.in\\nFirst of all thanks for giving such a detailed insight of yours on this contentious issue. brother i respect your views but we can differ.

Traveling faster than the speed of light, telepathy is thus inseparable from time understood as the experience of synchronicity.\\nIn light of the current planetary crisis and the need for humanity to return to the natural timing frequency, the 13 Moon calendar has been presented by the Foundation for the Law of Time as a first step toward reestablishing world harmony and universal peace.

For other uses of \"Trainer\", see Trainer.\\nThe Pokémon Trainer releases a random Pokémon from a Poké Ball.\\nThe Pokémon Trainer is a playable character in the game Super Smash Bros. Brawl. He is represented by Red, the main male character of Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Green Version, Pokémon Blue Version, Pokémon Yellow Version, and their remakes, using the design of the character first seen in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions.\\nPokémon Trainer artwork from Super Smash Bros. Brawl.\\nThe Pokémon Trainer is the first playable Pokémon representative in the Super Smash Bros. series who is not an actual Pokémon. Though a selectable character, he is not an actual fighter, instead commanding any of his three Pokémon in the background of the stage, his team consisting of Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard. The only move the trainer performs is Pokémon Change, which allows the player to switch out his three Pokémon at will throughout the battle. He also automatically switches Pokémon whenever one is KO\\'d. The Pokémon also run on a stamina system that weakens them, as their stamina decreases the longer they are out on the field. Their Final Smash is Triple Finish, which has the trainer send out all three Pokémon at once to attack. The Pokémon Trainer is voiced by Michele Knotz.\\nThe Pokémon Trainer in the Subspace Emissary.\\nIn the Subspace Emissary, he allies with Lucas who helps him find his Charizard and Ivysaur. The two also encounter Wario and a large Subspace Army robot, Galleom. They are saved from the robot\\'s detonation by Meta Knight, and they team with him, Marth and Ike afterwards. When encountering a huge Subspace Army group on the foothills of a mountain (Meta Knight has left to retake the Halberd), they are saved by Mario and his team (Link, Yoshi, Pit, and Kirby).\\nIn Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, transforming during battle is omitted, so Charizard was made into a separate character, while the Pokémon Trainer, Squirtle, and Ivysaur are no longer playable. He, Squirtle, and Ivysaur appear as collectable trophies, however.\\nThe male Pokémon Trainer in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\\nThe female Pokémon Trainer in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\\nPokémon Trainer returns as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. With the removal of the stamina system, one can play as Squirtle, Ivysaur, or Charizard for an extended period of time with no penalty. A female Pokémon Trainer variant can also be used, and is statistically identical to the male one. She is represented by Leaf, the main female character of Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version. Kate Bristol voices the female Pokémon Trainer, while Billy Bob Thompson voices the male. A majority of the male Pokémon Trainer\\'s quotes are also different from Super Smash Bros. Brawl as well.\\nPokémon Trainer (opposite gender) The Battle at the Summit!\\nPokémon Change is the Pokémon Trainer\\'s down special move, and by extension the down special move of Charizard, Squirtle, and Ivysaur. The move is based on the ability for players to switch out their Pokémon mid-battle in the Pokémon series, allowing players to switch between using Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard in that order. Pokémon Change is also automatically used whenever one of the Pokémon\\'s stamina is depleted or whenever one is KO\\'d. This move cannot be used immediately after respawning, or at all in midair. Status effects are also not carried over between Pokémon, though damage percentages are, and a Pokémon\\'s stamina recharges while it is not in use.\\nIn Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the move is much faster, and the stamina mechanic is removed. It can also be done in midair.\\nTriple Finish is the Pokémon Trainer\\'s Final Smash. The trainer sends out all three of his Pokémon to attack at the same time. Ivysaur hits with SolarBeam, a narrow beam of light that fires across the screen; Charizard with Fire Blast, a flame projectile that travels across the screen; and Squirtle with Hydro Pump, a water attack that sprays in multiple directions at close range, all of which deal continuous damage before opponents are knocked back by the final Fire Blast. If a player is too close to the team while they are attacking, they are knocked into the air rather than into the attack.\\nThroughout the entire attack, a text box designed after the ones in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl appears on the bottom of the screen, saying, \"Take that, Triple Finish!\" If the attack hits, the dialogue changes to say, \"It\\'s super effective!\", referencing the type effectiveness mechanic of the Pokémon series.\\nSince Charizard is the only Pokémon of the three to return in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, its Final Smash has been changed to its Mega Evolution.\\nPokémon Trainer A person who raises Pokémon and trains them as partners in battle. In battle, a Trainer gives orders to the Pokémon and uses items. It\\'s not an exaggeration to say battles can be won or lost on a Trainer\\'s single strategic move.

As hard as this reality is to accept, it is true. \"Luke does not try to gloss over the situation but relates the event with black colors.\\n\"1, 2. Sapphira in the Aramaic tongue means beautiful. Like Barnabas, she and her husband sold a piece of property. Ananias, with his wife\\'s knowledge, determined upon the plan of bringing only part of the money to the apostles, but pretending that they were giving all. 3.We are not told how Peter recognized this deception; it was probably by divine illumination. Peter charged Ananias not with deceiving him but with attempting to deceive the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is obviously a person, and verse 4 shows that the Holy Spirit is also God.\\n[\"In Acts 5:3, Peter said that Ananias had lied to the Holy Ghost: in Acts 5:4, he said that Ananias had lied to God.

While the land remained in Ananias\\' possession, it was his alone to dispose of as he chose; and even after he had sold it, the money was his to do with as he pleased. Ananias\\' sin did not consist in his keeping back the money, but in his pretending a complete consecration to God while deliberately keeping back part of the money.\\n\".The same fate that struck Ananias overtook Sapphira, and she fell down and expired. There is no reason to believe that Ananias and Sapphira were not saved persons. Their physical death was a divine judgment upon them which did not involve the question of their salvation. The very fact that they were believers determined the enormity of their sin. They were pretending to \"surrender all\" but were deliberately holding back from God. This is a sin that can be committed only by a Christian.\" (The Wycliffe Bible Commentary)\\nIt is possible for Christians to sin, even a sin unto death: \"If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin which does notlead to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I do not say that he should pray about that. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death.\" (1 John 5:16-17) We should not take lightly these warnings for Christians. I know of Christians, I believe, who went to heaven before they should have, as a result of their willful sin. Now the passage goes on to say, \"We know that whoever is born of God does not sin [practice sin]; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.\" (1 John 5:18)\\new believe that Christians are to live a victorious Christian life; that does not mean that they never sin, but that they don\\'t want to sin (Look at our Romans 7-8 study). However, they do sin and that is why we need these verses: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\" (1 John 1:8-10)\\nI have met people on both sides of the spectrum concerning the sin issue. Some Christians claim that they never sin, and others are afraid that they have committed the unpardonable sin. First, if you say that you have no sin and are perfect, you are lying because God says no one is perfect, not even Christians. Usually these people redefine sin as the \"big ones\" they think, like murder, adultery, and so on, but God does not make these distinctions in His word.\\nThe problem with this theory, that we can be perfect before we get to heaven, is that it just is not true, even though we are to be perfect as He is perfect; this is a goal that we will not totally reach until we get to heaven. That is why we need 1 John 1:9, because we do have a need, as Christians, to confess our sins. Peter gave Ananias and his wife Sapphira an opportunity to repent, but they didn\\'t take it, so they died for their unconfessed sin.\\nThe other case, where a Christian thinks he or she has committed the unpardonable sin, they have not, because they are under conviction of sin. If they had committed the unpardonable sin, they would not even be concerned about it, they would be so hardened. The mere fact that they are being convicted by the Holy Spirit shows that they can still be forgiven. The unpardonable sin is actually rejecting the Holy Spirit\\'s convicting of a person of their need of salvation. Once a person has died it is too late to repent and receive Christ\\'s pardon for salvation.\\nI believe, though, that we will see Ananias and Sapphira in heaven. You see, God has forgiven us in Christ, but we will have to give an account of our lives when we stand before Him. Many Christians in the Church have sinned like these two did, and many of these Christians have not died immediately. Why is this? It is because these two were used as examples of what God feels about us thinking that we can deceive Him. He knows everything we do, say, and think, so we need to be careful of our motives!\\nBefore we take the Holy Communion we need to examine ourselves, St. Paul says. \"Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord\\'s body. For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep [have died]. For if we would judge ourselves [1 John 1:9], we would not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\" (1 Corinthians 11:27-32)\\n(11) God is a holy God, someone has noted that the angels in Isaiah 6 are not saying \"love,\" \"love,\" \"love,\" when they are worshipping before God, but are saying, \"Holy,\" \"Holy,\" \"Holy!\" God wants us to live holy lives for our own well being and for His name\\'s sake, because that is whose we are; we are His name\\'s sake. \"He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name\\'s sake.\" (Psalm 23:3b)\\n\"This event brought great awe and fear of God into the church and exercised a purifying influence. Here for the first time in Acts the word for church, ekklēsia, appears. It means, called out, and refers to the calling out of Greek citizens from their homes to the public assembly for civic purposes. The word is taken over by the Greek OT and used of Israel as the people of God. Its use in the NT therefore indicates that the Church is the new people of God. This word is never used of a building. It designates both the church at large (5:11; 9:31; 20:28) and local congregations of believers (11:26; 13:1).\\n(12) \"The early Christians did not have their own building for worship but met in Solomon\\'s Porch, which bordered the east side of the vast temple area.\" (The Wycliffe Bible Commentary) Usually they met in homes or rented buildings as we will see in other parts of Acts.\\n\"Sings and wonders characterized the ministry of the early Church and are equally intended to be expected in and through the Church today. [1 Corinthians 12: 1-31, we have a study on this in our Corinthians commentary.]\\n\"One Heart and One Soul, POWER OF UNITY. The early church grew rapidly as \\'the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved\\' (Acts 2:27). In 4:32, 33, it is reported that the growing multitude of believers were experiencing a profound dimension of spiritual unity. First, they were \\'of one heart,\\' which is a description in the original Greek, meaning \\'in tune\\' or \\'in sync\\' with one another. To put it another way, they were all going the same way, spiritually together. Second, they were of \\'one soul\\' (sometimes translated as \\'one mind\\'). This has a wonderfully deep meaning in the original Greek. It literally means \\'to breathe\\' or \\'to breathe spiritually together.\\' The results of this quality of spiritual unity were both powerful and practical.\" (New Spirit Filled Life Bible)\\n\"The tragic and terrible weakness of the contemporary church is that its people are not rock solid in their faith in the living Lord Jesus Christ. Their leaders are so eager to pack their sanctuaries with happy people, so keen to come to an easy accommodation with the world, so willing to be soft on sin and tolerant of almost any lifestyle, that the church has almost no impact on our culture.\\n\"If we are going to shape our society to serve God and honor Him, it will not be at the ballot box or through the political powers per se. It will be by the relentless power of God\\'s own gracious Spirit becoming supremely in control of individual believers who are firm in their devotion to Christ. People, plain people who stand on their faith in our Father, will shape society and change our civilization for good more than will ten thousand, big-time TV campaigns with all their glitz and glamour.\\n\"God is not looking for smooth, slick communicators. He is looking for a few noble souls who will stand firm for Him, who will not flinch before their foes, who will not fear no matter how much others may rant and rave in rage. Let me name but a few of these dauntless ones:\\nJoseph in Egypt,\\nDaniel in Babylon,\\nPaul in Greece and Italy,\\nAugustine in Africa,\\nFlorence Nightingale in the Crimea,\\nWilberforce in Britain,\\nAbraham Lincoln in North America.\\nIt takes courage to be firm and fearless.\\nIt means a man or woman must be bold for God and His Word.\\nIt demands that we be different from the crowd.\\nBut our Father honors those who honor Him!\"\\n(What Makes LIFE Worth Livingby the author of A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23, W. Phillip Keller)\\n(13) The unsaved are watching us all the time to see if our salvation is real. Sometimes they may say things like, \"Oh, it is just a phase they are going through, they will get over it.\" Also, even though they may respect us they are afraid of what others will think of them if they get saved, or they are afraid of the persecution it will bring. Don\\'t give up, it may take years, but if we keep praying for them and keep living for the Lord they, in many cases, will come to know Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.\\nHere is a true account of this very same thing happening recently in India: \"The 105-year-old man stood before his fellow villagers. The people respected the elderly man and stood at rapt attention, waiting to hear what he had to say. As the words began to tumble out of his mouth, the people knew something was drastically different.\\n\"\\'My dear friends and villagers, so many years I misunderstood Christianity and I persecuted the Christians a lot,\\' he began. \\'But all these years I had no peace in my heart. Then I realized my sins and I came to know that only Jesus Christ could forgive my sins, and give me peace of mind. So whether you kill me or not, I am going to take baptism.\\'\\n\"The people were stunned at his bold confession of faith. They still could hardly believe their eyes when the centenarian and his family chose to be baptized and became active members of the local Gospel for Asia Believers Church.\\n\"GFA leaders in Tripura, where this man lives, were not surprised at the turn of events. They had been fasting and praying that God would remove the veil of opposition from the man\\'s eyes.Whether old or young, former persecutors of Christians are today embracing the faith they once resisted-thanks to the prayers of God\\'s people.\" (Gospel for Asia News Update December 2006)\\n(14) Now at this point in history so many were getting saved that the Apostles lost track of how many there were. \"Estimates of the size of the Church by 250 [AD] vary between five and twelve percent of the population of the [Roman] Empire.\" (Christianity Through The Centuries)\\n(15-16) \".so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.\" (Notice Peter didn\\'t take up an offering here, or even say anything about money!)\\nGod used special miracles to confirm His message to the people of that time at the beginning of the Church Age, but that is not to say that God cannot or will not do this type of thing again. The book of Acts is the blue-print for the Church, but we also need to understand that the foundation was laid by Jesus and the Twelve Apostles along with St. Paul. So you don\\'t lay down another foundation after the building is going.\\n\"For we are God\\'s fellow workers; you are God\\'s field, you are God\\'s building. According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" (1 Corinthians 3:9-11)\\n\"\\'Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.\\'. And they prayed and said, \\'You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.\\' And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.\" (Acts 1: 21-26) So today we do not have an apostleship as it was in the early Church, but there are apostles in the sense of missionaries, look at our Ephesians 4 study.\\n\"The shadow of Peter was not magic nor was it intended to provide a formula. Sometimes God uses physical objects as a point at which our faith may make a kind of link between the seen and the unseen (see 19:12). The bread and cup of Communion, the water of baptism, and the anointing oil (James 5:14) are some examples.\" (New Spirit Filled Life Bible)\\nThat being said, some today are making money out of sending pieces of cloth that have been prayed over, and they add, healing will follow if you send us money, but (they imply) \"no money, no healing.\" How far from the truth, and how perverted are such people who would teach and preach such things! All I can say is that they will be judged for such a perversion of the precious, glorious Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ! Salvation is a free gift, and healing is also a free gift!\\nIn the Old Testament there is an example of someone making profit out of healing and what happened to him:\\nNow Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper.Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha\\'s house. And Elisha sent a messenger to him.So he [Naaman].went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\\nAnd he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, \\'Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.\\' But he said, \\'As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive nothing.\\' And he urged him to take it, but he refused.Then he said to him, \\'Go in peace.\\' So he departed from him a short distance.\\nBut Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, \\'Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as the LORD lives, I will run after him and take something from him.\\nSo Naaman said, \\'Please, take two talents.\\' And he urged him, and bound two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants; and they carried them on ahead of him. When he came to the citadel, he took them from their hand, and stored them away in the house; then he let the men go, and they departed.\\nNow he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, \\'Where did you go, Gehazi? And he said, \\'Your servant did not go anywhere.\\' Then he said to him, \\'Did not my heart gowith you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyard, sheep and oxen, male and female servants? Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your descendants forever.\\' And he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow.\" (2 Kings 5: 1-27)\\nHere is but one example of the perversion from our day of what God intended for healing gifts, and how they should be used: \"—— [Name of a person] then promised that anyone suffering from an extreme financial crisis need only carry the prayer cloth in a purse, wallet, or checkbook to receive a financial breakthrough. There was one small catch: Before the cloth could work, it had to be sent back to ——. The prayer cloth, according to ——, presently \\'does not carry or contain any special anointing or qualities. It is just a simple piece of plain cloth.but in a few days (if you act in faith RIGHT NOW) it can become a MIRACLE PRAYER CLOTH.\\' But —— had one more suggestion: When you return the cloth, be sure to send money. As —— puts it, \\'Receiving follows giving.\\'\" (Christianity in Crisis)\\nThe Church has not seen the likes of such teaching since Martin Luther confronted John Tetzel for the selling of indulgences. Look what was happening in Luther\\'s time: \"The prior of the Dominican convent at Leipzig, John Tetzel, was selling these indulgences. When he entered Juterbog where Luther\\'s people went to see and hear him, he had the papal bull, announcing the indulgence, carried on velvet cloth at the head of a procession.\\n\"With great pomp and ceremony he marched through the streets of the town to the place of preaching. There, in unbelievable boldness, he promised to the Saxons that they could buy release from all punishment imposed by church law; they also could buy release from the penances they must do in purgatory for their sins.\\n\"With mock pathos and brutal hypocrisy, he painted for the benefit of his hearers the sufferings of their dead relatives in purgatory and told them point-blank that they could release their loved ones from suffering by paying a little money. Duped by these promises, the unlettered Germans whom Luther looked upon as his sheep, believed the great reward of character thus could be bought.\" (Heroes of the Faith, Martin Luther, Edwin P. Booth)\\nSo it is today, some are preaching another gospel, and some are \"selling the gospel.\" Healing comes all of \"faith\" and faith in God\\'s power, not faith in faith! Nor does God charge for salvation or healing! \"And the Spirit and the bride say, \\'Come!\" And let him who hears say, \\'Come!\\' And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.\" (Revelation 22:17)\\n(17-18) Tertullian said, \"The blood of the martyr is often the seed of the Church.\" \"Such rapid growth was not without much opposition on the part of the Jews. Quickly the ecclesiastical authorities realized that Christianity offered a threat to their prerogatives as interpreters and priests of the law, and they rallied their forces to combat Christianity. Persecution came first from a politico-ecclesiastical body, the Sanhedrin, which, with Roman permission, supervised the civil and religious life of the state. Peter and John were hailed before that august body at least twice and forbidden to preach the Gospel, but they refused to accede to the request.\" (Christianity Through the Centuries, Cairns)\\n(19-21) Men of this world and enemies of the cross think they can physically stop the spread of the Gospel into the entire world. Whatever they do will only \\'backfire\\' in their faces, here they think by locking up some of the apostles they will stop the spread of the good news of Christ\\'s resurrection. This only makes Christ\\'s disciples more determined than ever that they are walking in the truth and light, while the Sadducees \"are sad you see\" because they are walking in darkness.\\n\"5:17 Sadducees. Strangely, the chief priests were all members of the Sadducees, the religious party which (like the pagan nations around them denied the doctrine of resurrection. Therefore, they were increasingly furious at the effectiveness of the powerful preaching of the resurrection by the apostles (Acts 4:33; 6:7). 5:20 Go, stand. Regardless of opposition or difficulties the Lord expects His people to stand-that is, to take a stand, once and for all (Ephesians 6:13, 14)-and to speak-to speak all the words of this life, just as the apostles\\'spake the word of God with boldness\\' (Acts 4:31)\" (The Defender\\'s Study Bible)\\nIn this case the apostles were not in common prison long because an angel took them out. They didn\\'t let fear take hold of them, but they went right back to work preaching the gospel in the temple. The high priest, after having breakfast decided to have the apostles for lunch, but he was to have a big surprise instead!\\nAngels are spoken of throughout the Bible; actually there are more references to angels in the New Testament than in the Old. They are always helping believers. They were with Christ at His birth, resurrection, and ascension. Now we see them at work in the ministry of the early Church. Do you suppose they have stopped ministering to the saints? No, I don\\'t think so, they are always doing their job, even though we don\\'t see them, at least we don\\'t think we see them. \"Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some have unwittingly entertained angels.\" (Hebrews 13:2)\\nGod delivers some, and others He allows to stay in jail. John Bunyan spent something like twelve years in an English jail, however, as a result of that time he wrote Pilgrim\\'s Progress, which has brought multitudes to the saving grace of Christ. Paul himself spent many years in jail, \"We need to bloom where we are planted,\" as someone has said.\\nAt that time, at the inception of the Church, there were just a few suffering for the Lord Jesus Christ; today many around the world suffer in prisons and in many other horrible ways. There is probably more persecution today than at any other time in Church history. One reason for so many being persecuted is because there are more Christians than there has ever been before.\\nHere are just a few of the countries where Christians are put in prison and tortured for their faith:\\nChina, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar (Burma), Brunei and Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Northern Sudan, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Northern Nigeria, Cuba, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Eritrea, Somalia, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza Strip, Chiapas (Mexico), Colombia, Turkey, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, parts of India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mindanao (Philippines), Comoro Islands.\\n\"Richard Wurmbrand learned firsthand that although you can imprison the body, no one can bind the soul. He later learned his solitary cell was adjacent to the toilet (if you could call it that) where prisoners would line up each morning. He began to shout through the wall. \"God is good.\" \"Jesus died for your sins.\" \"Believe in Jesus.\" \"He is your only hope.\" \"Hallelujah!\"\\nRichard became know as the \"Hallelujah Pastor\" and his reputation spread throughout the prisons in Romania-an unseen and unnamed pastor who shouted through concrete walls to bring hope to others.\\nRichard spent a total of 14 years in prison, three of those years in solitary confinement.

Now they seem to have forgotten what they had said earlier or maybe they were bothered by it. At any rate, they are still responsible for Jesus death, along with all the rest of the world, since we are all sinners, and He died for our sins! However, the Jewish nation does have the blood of Jesus on their hands, and until they ask God the Father\\'s forgiveness for this they will not have God\\'s protection or blessing as they had before. Once they do ask God the Father to forgive them, and ask Jesus to save them, He will. He will forgive and save them as individuals and as a nation. Then He will bless them, beyond what the world could ever fathom!\\n(29) \"5:29 ought to obey God. Christians are commanded to \\'be subject unto higher powers\\' (Romans 13:1) and to\\'submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord\\'s sake\\' (1 Peter 2:13), with this one exception. They had been commanded not to \\'teach in this name\\' (Acts 5:28), but God had said: \\'Stand and speak\\' (Acts 5:20). God\\'s commands take priority, but they should be His commands, not our extensions of those commands.\" (The Defender\\'s Study Bible)\\n(30) The disciples did not mince any words when they said to the false religious leaders, \"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree.\"\\n(31-32) \"The gift of the Holy Spirit, whom Luke notes is given to all believers at the time of salvation, bears witness to the reality of the exaltation of Jesus.\"\\n(33-42) Gamaliel, Paul\\'s former teacher (22:3), did not see Jesus as the Messiah, but his counsel to the Sanhedrin was certainly influenced by divine providence. Luke\\'s more subtle message is that even the highest levels of Jewish leadership had to admit that they had no valid reason for resisting the early church.\" (New Spirit Filled Life Bible)\\n\"Compare Acts 2:37. The Gospel, when preached in the power of the Holy Spirit, often convicts or enrages.\" (New Scofield Reference Edition)\\n\"5:34 Gamaliel, a Pharisee rather than a Sadducee like the chief priests and well instructed in the Scriptures, had been the teacher of young Paul before the latter became a Christian (Acts 22:3)\\n\"5:39 ye cannot overthrow it. Gamaliel may well have known Nicodemus, who was also a member of the council, a Pharisee, and a respected teacher (John 3:1,10). He must have been profoundly impressed by the conversion and devotion of Nicodemus to Jesus, and then by the empty tomb and the reports of Christ\\'s resurrection. He had good reason to fear that suppression of the Christians might indeed be fighting against God.\" (The Defender\\'s Study Bible)\\n\"In the above incident, Dr. Griffith-Thomas notices three representative forces-the spirit of error (the Sadducees); the spirit of compromise (Gamaliel); the spirit of truth (Peter).\" (Myer Pearlman)\\n\"38,39 Gamaliel counseled the Sanhedrin to trust God\\'s providence.

The apostles were by no means discouraged, for they considered it an honor to suffer for the name of Jesus. They continued their activities of teaching and preaching of Jesus as the Messiah, both publicly in the Court of the Gentiles in the temple and in their Christian gatherings in their private homes.\" (The Wycliffe Bible Commentary)\\n\"Both public services in the temple and small group meetings in private homes were employed for the nurturing of believers. Luke establishes both types of meetings as a paradigm, vital to the life of any local congregation (2:46).\" (New Spirit Filled Life Bible)\\n(1) \"Up to this point, the apostles had given no evidence of a purpose to carry the Gospel into all the world but had stayed in Jerusalem witnessing to the Jews. Luke now relates the beginnings of expansion of the church throughout Judea and Samaria, which was occasioned by the persecution that arose around Stephen. This expansion was accomplished not by the vision and purpose of the church but by the providential act of God in scattering the believers. To explain this persecution, Luke first relates how Stephen came into a position of prominence as one of the seven.\\n\"Choice of the Seven. 6:1-7.

The numerical growth of the church and the rise of problems in its internal organization and the choice of additional leaders or ministers.\\n\"Jews who were natives of Palestine spoke primarily Aramaic; but Jews who had lived in the Mediterranean world outside of Palestine spoke Greek and often did not know Aramaic. Many of these Diaspora Jews returned to Jerusalem to live, and some of them were converted and came into the church.\\n\"A contention now arose between the Greek-speaking Christians (Grecians) [Hellenists] and the Aramaic-speaking Christians (Hebrews) because it appeared that favoritism for the latter was being shown in the distribution of food to the widows. Widows were persons without any means of support, who were provided with the bare necessities of life by the Christian community.\\n(2) \"The twelve apostles called together the entire church and pointed out that this responsibility for the care of the poor had become such a burden that they found themselves devoting most of their time to this material ministry and neglecting the ministry of the Word. Such neglect was not right.

[The Apostles were looking for three things in leadership: 1. Men of good reputation 2. Full of the Holy Spirit 3.

All seven had Greek names and apparently were drawn from the Greek wing of the church.

The seven were then ordained to their office by the imposition of the apostles\\' hands. This laying on of hands was an OT custom (Gen. 48:13 ff.; Lev. 1:4; Num. 27:23), which was also practiced by the Jews when men were admitted to the Sanhedrin.\\n\"It was taken over by the early church for the ordination of these leaders. A preliminary qualification, however, was that the seven be filled with the Holy Spirit. Aside from the apostles, these seven were the first officials in the church.

I have known of churches that grew very quickly through evangelism or other forms of church growth, but then they just collapsed because they were not organized, nor did they have trained people to teach the new converts. So here again we see the blueprint for the Church.\\n\"One of a series of progress reports given periodically throughout the book of Acts (1:15; 2:41; 4:4; 5:14; 6:7; 9:31; 12:24; 16:5; 19:20; 28:31). A large number of priests. Though involved by lineage and life service in the priestly observances of the old covenant, they accepted the preaching of the apostles, which proclaimed a sacrifice that made the old sacrifices unnecessary (Heb 8:13; 10:1-4, 11-14) became obedient to the faith. Responded to the commands of the gospel. To believe is to obey God. Faith itself is obedience, but faith also produces obedience (Ro 1:1:5; Eph 2:8-10; Jas 2:14-26).\" (The NIV Study Bible)\\n(8) Notice also that miracles were the norm in the early Church. Are they the norm today or the exception? If they are the exception what has happened? Has God changed? Or is it that we have changed?!\\n(9) \"[Stephen] was bearing witness to the Messiahship of Jesus in the Jewish synagogues in Jerusalem, particularly in one that was attended by Freedmen\\n(RSV; Libertines, AV) who had formerly lived in the four places named. A\\nsynagogue was composed of ten or more Jews who met together for the reading and interpretation of the Scriptures. An exaggerated tradition says there were 480 synagogues in Jerusalem.\" (The Wycliffe Bible Commentary).\\n\"The \\'Libertines\\' [Freedmen] were freedmen, formerly slaves. All of these groups were Jewish immigrants to Jerusalem from other lands, who had evidently formed their own synagogue. As such, they were quite legalistic and very zealous of the Mosaic traditions, especially the temple worship. They may well have immigrated to Jerusalem for this very reason.\" (The Defender\\'s Study Bible)\\n\"Freedmen. Persons who had been freed from slavery. [But not from the slavery of sin!] They came from different Hellenistic areas. Cyrene. The chief city in Libya and north Africa.halfway between Alexandria and Carthage. One of its population groups was Jewish. Alexandria. Capital of Egypt and second only to Rome in the empire. Two out of five districts in Alexandria were Jewish.\\n\"Cilicia. A Roman province in the southeast corner of Asia Minor adjoining Syria. Tarsus, the birthplace of Paul, was one of its principal towns. Asia. A Roman province in the western part of Asia Minor. Ephesus, where Paul later ministered for a few years, was its capital. These men began to argue. Since Saul was from Tarsus, this may have been the synagogue he attended, and he may have been among those who argued with Stephen.\" (The NIV Study Bible)\\n(10) When a Christian is testifying for the Lord this is called witnessing. It will involve a spiritual warfare! Every time we tell others that Jesus is the only way to heaven we will suffer persecution.\\nAll of this was prophesied by Jesus that it would happen. \"But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers for My name\\'s sake. But it will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony. Therefore settle it in your hearts not to meditate beforehand on what you will answer; for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or resist.\" (Luke 21:12-15)\\n(11-14) \"blasphemy against Moses and against God. Since Stephen declared that the worship of God was no longer to be restricted to the temple (7:48-49), his opponents twisted these words to trump up an accusation that Stephen was attacking the temple, the law, Moses and, ultimately, God.\" (The NIV Study Bible)\\n\"6:13 false witnesses. Stephen had been accused of blasphemy against the temple and the law, but even though the false witnesses had distorted his message, Stephen did not attempt to defend himself. Instead he probably presented the same type of message to the council as he had been preaching in the synagogue, stressing that the principles of God\\'s plan for Israel had been established long before the temple system, and that the Abrahamic Covenant centered in the promised Messiah, as did the preaching of the prophets. But Israel had rejected God\\'s Word at every stage, had killed the prophets, corrupted the law and finally murdered the Messiah when He came.\" (The Defender\\'s Study Bible)\\n\"The same argument had been leveled at Jesus (Matt. 26:60, 61). Actually, the coming of Christ meant the end of the temple order, which was the foundation and centerpiece of Judaism.\" (New Spirit Filled Life Bible)\\n(15) \"And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel.\" (NKJV) God was preparing Stephen for a grand entrance into his heavenly home, as He does for all His Christian martyrs! \"Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. Still others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, and of chains and imprisonment.\\nThey were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented-\\nOf whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains. In dens and caves of the earth. And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith.\" (Hebrews 11:35b-40)\\nI have had Christians tell me that if Stephen had had enough faith he would not have had to suffer stoning. This could not be further from the truth, just the opposite is true, Hebrews 11: 35b says, \"Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.\"\\nNot only that, we see the heavens opened, ready to receive Stephen with open arms! No, there is no lack of faith here. \"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and said, \\'Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!\" (Acts 7:55-56)\\nDon\\'t believe for a minute, this foolish teaching that Christians don\\'t have to suffer if they have enough faith! What does Holy Scripture say? \"Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ\\'s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified.\" (1 Peter 4:12-14) (NKJV)\\n(1-59) \"Stephen\\'s lengthy address is more than a rebuttal of the charges against him. Rather than defending himself, he brought an indictment against his accusers. Instead of manifesting a true zeal for the temple and the Law in their opposition to the gospel, the Jews were displaying the same rebellious spirit of unbelief that characterized their forebears who resisted the purposes of God. In a skillful review of Israel\\'s history, he also concludes that God\\'s presence is not limited to a geographical place nor to a particular people.\" (New Spirit Filled Life Bible)\\n\"Running through his discourse are the following thoughts:\\n\"1. Divine revelation is progressive. Stephen had been accused of preaching that the Law of Moses would pass away (6:14). Though his words had been misquoted and their meaning perverted, Stephen had evidently been preaching the passing of the age of law, and the ushering in of the age of grace. So he shows that God has always been giving new revelations of Himself.\\n\"First He revealed Himself to Abraham, through the institution of the altar; to Moses in the burning bush and on Mount Sinai; then to Israel, through the tabernacle, and finally through the temple. Stephen shows that God\\'s dwelling in the tabernacle and temple was only symbolical (vv. 48, 49). God now dwells in and reveals Himself in reality through a new institution-the Church.\\n\"2. He had been accused of declaring that the temple would be destroyed (6:14). He shows that the temple is not the only holy place, but that God reveals Himself anywhere He finds an open heart. He revealed Himself to Abraham in Mesopotamia (v.2); to Joseph in Egypt (vv. 9-12); to Moses in Egypt (v. 25), and in the wilderness (vv. 30-33, 38).\\n\"3. Israel has always rejected God\\'s first offer of mercy, suffered for it, and then has accepted it the second time. They rejected Joseph and Moses the first time, but accepted them the second time (vv. 9-13, 24-35). In like manner they have rejected Jesus but after they have suffered, they will accept His second offer.\" (Through the Bible Book by Book by Myer Pearlman)\\nStephen concluded this with these two charges: \"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers.\" (7:51-52 NKJV)\\n\"And the LORD God of their fathers sent warnings to them by His messengers, rising up early and sending them, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against His people, tillthere was no remedy.\" (2 Chronicles 15-16 NKJV)\\n\"Yet for many years You had patience with them, and testified against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets. Yet they would not listen; therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.\" (Nehemiah 9:30 NKJV)\\nJust like Jesus, Stephen, with his last breath forgave those who sinned against him. \"Then Jesus said, \\'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.\\'\" (Luke 23:34) \"And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on\\nGod and saying, \\'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\\' Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, \\'Lord, do not charge them with this sin.\\' And when he had said this he fell asleep.\" (7:59-60 NKJV) Sleep is a metaphor for death.\\nStephen\\'s prayer was answered in Saul. \".and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.\" (7:58) \".although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.\" (1 Timothy 1:13-14)\\nStephen was the first in the Church to be martyred, but since him millions upon millions of Christians have suffered for their precious Lord Jesus Christ.\\n\"Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword. For I have come to\\'set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\" and a man\\'s enemies will be those of his own household.\\' He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.\" (Matthew 10:34-39)\\nDownload a PDF version of this article:Acts3_English<|begin_of_text|>Snøffeltøffs\\nYou want some garage, but nothing too garage (you still know all the lyrics to \\'Spice Up Your Life\\'). You want something pop, but you bought that Velvet Underground t-shirt from H&M and you don\\'t want people to think you\\'re frontin\\'. Entré Snøffeltøffs: Berlin\\'s pop-meets-garage sonic brawl of jangling, danceable indie tunes. They talk to us about terrible tour luck, pasta with ketchup, and they teach us an important lesson about proof-reading questions before sending them.\\nTHE LO DOWN\\nBangOn Team: Tell us a little about your band/project. What\\'s your sound?\\new\\'re Snøffeltøffs from Berlin. A project started by Florian and Julian about 5 years ago. We\\'ve known each other for fifteen years now and decided to work together after we played in several other more-or-less successful bands. It\\'s a project and not a band because it involves more people than just the band members. In 2016 Meghan from Cape Town joined to play drums. We used to describe our sound as \\'Hi-Fi, Lo-Fi, Shit-Fi\\' when we were a two piece. Now it\\'s \\'Lo-Fi Garage for Pop Lovers. Lo-Fi Pop for Garage Lovers.\\'\\nBOT: How do you go about songwriting?\\nJulian: It\\'s a pretty spontaneous process.\\nFlorian: Usually, someone comes up with a great idea and then we try to completely destroy it in the rehearsal room. People have called us unapproachable before, but critics said the same about The Velvet Underground, so I guess that\\'s okay. It\\'s the only way we can work really.\\nMeghan: The guys connect musically automatically and it takes them like five seconds to come up with a new song idea. Then I \\'beautiful mind\\' it and make tons of diagrams and notes to work out a structure for myself, then they make me throw away the papers, and then I have a meltdown, then we have beers and talk about turtles and seagulls, usually, and then the song is born. I had a lot of fun learning the songs from their first album, Hokus Pokus (which I think is great) and the songs we worked on together for the new album coming out later this year.\\nJ: We\\'re not meeting up and say, \\'Okay, we gotta come up with a song now, any ideas?\\'\\nBOT: Who are your biggest influences?\\nJ: Everyday life.\\nM: Ringo Starr and Phil Rudd when it comes to drummers.\\nF: Weird people we randomly meet.\\nBOT: What\\'s been your lowest and highest point as a band/project?\\nF: Coming back from an ill-fated Europe tour completely broke, owing the bank €2000\\nand having to live off about a Euro a day for the next couple of months– not being able to buy even remotely appropriate christmas presents for the parents. Yeah, that was pretty bad. Or opening for Eagles Of Death Metal and having to get off stage fifteen minutes into the show because of technical problems. That was pretty bad too. At least we got good money for the EODM show, which was kind of a high point… Oh no, wait, we lost all that money two weeks later because of a car crash in Prague. Or spending a lot of money on an album that was never released (great songs, though!). I guess the highest point was when we realized that, despite having had so much bad luck, we\\'re still doing this when other bands probably would have broken up a long time ago. That\\'s something we\\'re really proud of. Proves that friendship is stronger than band politics.\\nJ: Yes! Florian just summed up the highs of all low points in the past five years. Another low point we just talked about last week is an interview we did right in the beginning where we got quoted completely wrong, then sounded like rich arrogant musicians and had to explain ourselves for two years because people kept on asking what we meant.\\nBut even this all sounds pretty bad to others, we never ever even thought about splitting up. Friendship and music is stronger than cancelled bank accounts and pasta with ketchup.\\nBOT: What\\'s your ultimate aim?\\nJ: Make more albums, go on tour and make music great again.\\nF: Not having to play Squier guitars anymore.\\nM: To be able to continue playing more shows and always become a better player.\\nBOT: You have the chance to play one song for a legend of your choice. What do you play?\\nM: I\\'d like to play \\'Bitch Don\\'t Kill My Vibe\\' by Kendrick Lamar for Ginger Spice.\\nF: I\\'d like to play \\'Safety Dance\\' by Men Without Hats for Stefani Germanotta, because I read she likes it too and I think she\\'s pretty kewl.\\nJ: \\'Linus & Lucy (Snoopy Theme)\\' to Elton John.\\nYour friends don\\'t dance. But ours do.\\nBOT: What does Berlin do for you musically? What do we have to look forward to in the coming months from you?\\nF: You get the chance to see and meet a different band at a different venue basically every single day of the week, which is more than any musician could ever ask for.\\nJ: Which can also be pretty tiring to be honest because it\\'s just too much. It\\'s like the best town to make music; you just gotta find the right people or have to grow up with them. Apart from that we\\'re about to finish our second album which took some time and we want to extend the band with more members.\\nM: For me Berlin has always been very inspiring. I come from Cape Town: a beautiful city, but it\\'s also very laid back and super chill. I love the way it feels like anything is possible here, that sounds really lame, but i really do feel that way.\\nChoose one random question of your choice. (Editor\\'s note: We never expected such a direct and Snøffeltøffsish interpretation of this question!

Okay... Wait that\\'s the Human Centipede. I don\\'t know what a human caterpillar is but I\\'m gonna say...

Louis XI awarded him with honours. In 1462, Jacques succeeded his father, and Louis XI married him to his god-daughter, Louise of Anjou, daughter of Charles of Le Maine. Louis XI also recognized his title to the duchy of Nemours, which he had disputed with the King of Navarre.\\n\\nSent by Louis to pacify Roussillon, Nemours felt that he had been insufficiently rewarded for the rapid success of this expedition, and joined the League of the Public Weal in 1465. Subsequently, he reconciled with Louis, but soon resumed his intrigues.

Jenny is a prominent lawyer and is a partner with her firm. Tom is a semi famous physician who owns his own practice and can be heard on the local radio station as a guest star dispensing medical advice. Jenny has just gone back to work after having given birth to their second daughter. The say this family is well off would be an understatement. To say this family is not well financially organized would be laughable. But even the classic well off family struggles with the possibility of buying whole life insurance.\\nBoth Jenny and Tom have multiple insurance policies. Jenny has a group life policy at her firm and a small $500K 25 year term policy that she purchased when you she first got pregnant with her oldest daughter. Tom owns a small key man life insurance policy through work, which is used for business purposes. He also has a small 20 year policy of $600K for his personal use.\\nWhen Jenny and Tom first purchased their new house 8 years ago, they found their old insurance company was unable to write the insurance due to the value of the home and the proximity to a wildfire area. The home is currently insured with one of the higher cost affluent insurance companies. Their three autos are also covered by the same insurer. We will refer to this company as PRP Home and Auto insurance. When they met their Property and Causality insurance agent he quickly assesses that they had a real need for purchasing and maintaining an Umbrella policy. The Umbrella Insurance policy sits over their main home, second vacation/rental home in Colorado, and three cars. It is written in the amount of $3 Million US Dollars with an additional $1 Million US Dollars in excess uninsured motorist coverage.\\nBoth Jenny and Tom maintain Professional Liability Insurance due to the nature of their licenses and work. Both of their businesses are fully insured.\\nThe Wangs are financial savers… They met at local investor conference and with the suggestion of a friend, Tom initially asked out Jenny. After the fourth date they quickly became inseparable and married a year or so later. Both Jenny and Tom love investing and saving money. Tom is more interested in risky investments and Jenny is more interested paying off every debt they have. However both of them agree in living well below their means. Because they both save so much, there biggest financial problem is deciding where to invest or save their extra dollars.\\nBecause the couple saves upwords of 20% of their pretax take home pay, the couple has amassed quite an array of savings. Their home, purchased just eight years ago was originally purchased for $1.2 Million Dollars, but has risen in value to something in the nature of $1.5 Million Dollars. Because they make at least one, if not two, extra mortgage payments per year and because they put so much down when they bought it, their mortgage sits at around $635,000. They have a very competitive mortgage rate.\\nTheir second home, is mostly rented out during the year and is located in a ski town in Colorado. It is a condo, which is valued at about $515,000 and they carry a $310,000 mortgage on it. Since it is mostly rented out, the Wangs CPA has advised them that they are getting a small tax advantage from owning it.\\nOther than their two homes, the couple has numerous other assets, including two 401Ks for Jenny valued at about $612,000 and a Roth IRA of $75,000. Tom has one 401K in the amount of $105,000, SEP IRA valued at $367,000 and an old Roth IRA in the amount of $34,000.\\nAs impressive as that all sounds the couple also has ample non retirement savings as well: An online savings account with 162,000 and a local joint saving account held at the local bank with $23,500. They have a investment account held with a national investment company that is mostly invested in passive ETFs and municipal bond funds in the amount of $459,000. They have various other small investments totaling about $45,000.\\nTheir oldest daughter has a 529 account that lists her as a beneficiary with about $51,000 and the youngest daughter has a brand new 529 with her listed as the beneficiary. This account has only $10,000. Both 529 accounts receive automatic monthly deposits of $1,000 per month. The couple is confident that between the current balance and future monthly deposits will be able to cover most of their children\\'s undergraduate costs.\\nBoth of their daughters also have less than $10K (8K, 2K) set aside for them in California UTMA accounts through their national broker. Whenever Jenny receives gifts for her two girls she immediately deposits the money into the accounts.\\nOther than the two mortgage listed above, the only debt that the couple has is a small residual amount of medical school debt in the amount of $45,000. Jenny was lucky in having saved enough and was helped by her parents to pay off law school long ago. But her husbands medical school debt is a source of anxiety for her. Both Tom and her argue about it often. Tom thinks that they should just allow it to be paid off on time, while Jenny would like to write a check and be done with it.\\nThe Wangs are cash flow positive, meaning they are easily taking in more money than they are spending. They drive nice autos, but plan to drive them until they are at least ten years old. They have few things that they consider luxuries and do not enjoy the expensive lifestyle of many of their children\\'s parents friends, preferring to spend time with extended family.\\nThe take in excess at least $550,000 per year and sometimes up to $650,000 per year.\\nIncluding their homes, 529s, children\\'s UTMA accounts, they have total assets of about $2,678,500 not including the increased value of their primary home of about $300,000. This net worth does not take into account numerous things including, but not limited to: Their Autos, There general possessions, Their small art collection, nor the potential use of social security at retirement. It also completely excludes Tom\\'s Physicians practice and Jenny\\'s Law partnership as these businesses are extremely hard to value. However, they do have value.\\nEven with this amazing amount of savings Jenny does not feel secure. She worrys constantly about Tom getting sued for the medical advice he shares on the radio as well as his practice Being a lawyer herself, she knows that the barrier in the United States to merely begin legal proceedings against someone is rather low. And although Tom carrys Malpractice insurance, she worrys that it may not be enough.\\nTom is not worried about this too much and claims that getting sued is part of being a business owner. He is however, slightly concerned about the stock market and is constantly looking for investments outside of stocks. He believes that between their investment accounts and retirement accounts, they are over placed into the market as a whole.\\nBoth Tom and Jenny save the maximum allowable amount into their Work Retirement plans. About $16,000 plus an employer contribution of $5K for Jenny and Tom with a SEP IRA contribution of somewhere between $18K to $35K per year. Jenny also puts money into a non deductible IRA yearly and converts it to a Roth IRA. They squirrel away about $24K per year into the kids 529 plans, make extra mortgage payments, and are fully insured. They add at least $30K to $35K per year to their online saving bank and deposit the rest of their savings joint the National Investment Company buying up Muni ETFs and Passive Stock ETFs. Soon they worry that their oldest child\\'s 529 will have all it needs and then what should they do? But what else to do with their money?\\nTom reads some stories and meets a pushy insurance agent at a golf outing who has been trying to convince him that a whole life insurance policy is the best thing since the sucher. This Life Insurance agent sponsors events and specializes in Life Insurance policies for wealthy doctors. All the doctors joke about him, when he not around. However, one of the wealthiest older docs in the group, tells the group that his ideas are not entirely wrong.\\nNot wanting to approach the life insurance agent, Tom does some research online and finds general condemnation for whole life insurance and its ugly cousins Universal and Variable Life. However in his reading he does see claims that Whole Life Insurance can serve as a form of asset protection and this appeals to him. More Life Insurance is probably a good thing, thinks Tom. After reading this he calls and schedules a quick meeting in his office with his golfing insurance agent. One of the things that immediately bothers Tom about the insurance agent is the lack of needs based questioning that the insurance agent has with him. The insurance agent is adamant that whole life insurance is the best thing in the world for most families and that term life insurance will run out, leaving the Wangs \"life insurance less.\" Tom immediately thinks this is funny because the insurance agent has no idea what his net worth is, nor their need for life insurance after their term policies end. He wants to end the meeting right then and there, but gets diverted by an incoming emergency phone call. After the phone call he allows the patient salesmen to continue.\\nThe conversation continues with the insurance agent reviewing some key reasons that doctors really should consider a whole life policy, including possible asset protection and a small interest rate paid through dividends in the participating whole life policy. Caught off guard, not knowing what dividends are in relationship to life insurance, Dr Tom, immediately starts taking notes. The insurance agent brags that his A+ carrier has paid out dividends for decades. After learning about the dividends, Tom Wang learns that this insurance agent has only one insurance company that he sells for. Tom is slightly concerned about this and decides its time to read up and speak with more people.\\nTom, discusses the presentation with his wife who in intrigued with the concept of a contract based saving plan but is confused by the combination with an insurance product. She suggest that Tom reach out to the their P&C Insurance Agent Bobby. Bobby is more than happy to discuss Permanent Life Insurance options, mostly offered by PRP Insurance Holdings and after a medium length needs based discussion, zones in an Indexed Universal Life Insurance policy insisting that it is all the rage these days. Tom is a bit put off by this as in their original phone discussion he had mentioned wanting a non stock market savings plan and the Indexed Universal Life insurance policy is somewhat tied to market performance. Also when asked about how it was linked, Bobby the P&C agent explained it, but not well. The whole thing seemed too confusing to Tom and he was not comfortable with the agents level of knowledge on the situation.\\nTom then reaches out to a former Wealth Manager that had long ago drawn up a fee for service financial plan for Tom, back when he was single. Tom\\'s recollection was that her work was terrific, but that the Wealth Manager wanted him to let her manage his assets. Not wanting to pay 1.1% per year for this service Tom demurred. With a renewed interest from an old Client, Sally the Wealth Manager quickly surveyed the landscape and did hint that a Whole Life Insurance plan could… be useful to someone in their financial situation. They discussed Indexed Universal Life plans, but she suggested that these life insurance policies were laden with high fees and confusing calculations of investment limitations and caps. Sally hinted that Participating Whole Life, if nothing else, was less complex than Indexed Universal and was indeed less market sensitive. Although she did bring up her belief that although Participating Whole Life Insurance companies were not stocks and did not usually own too many in their portfolio, they were at risk of bond performance since they usually had many in their portfolios.\\nIn the end the Wealth Manager really thought a better move was one of investing in new markets for the couple. She suggested a portfolio of Emerging Markets, and High Yield debt, feeling that the Wangs did not hold these types of investments currently.\\nFrustrated, now Tom does not know what to do. He was not going to hire a Wealth Manager and was certainly not going to be pushed into an Indexed Universal policy. He still felt his best option lay with the Golfing Insurance Agent, but wanted someone to review his needs from multiple companies. Tom tables the discussion with his wife and faisl to decide what to do.\\nA year goes by and Jenny no longer wants to put any more money into their oldest daughters 529 plan as she calculates that it is probably enough for their daughters future education in about 13 years. She doubles up on the contributions to her youngest daughters 529 plan from $1,000 to $2,000 per month. Both children are invested in the age (graduation) based portfolios so they are essentially on autopilot. Jenny is concerned that they now really have more money to invest than they know what to do with. A good problem to have, but it keeps her up at night.\\nJenny starts a small project of looking at the Alternative World of Investments that they can make with their small pile of money. She considers purchasing a $100K rental property near where her parents live in Arizona. Buying into a Hedge Fund. Investing in a small local restaurant through a friend. All of the options scare her though. When Jenny and Tom discuss the subject its clear that she is the safe investor and Tom likes to push the risk meter. Jenny brings up the whole life option again to Tom.\\nAlthough by this time Tom has been referred to multiple other insurance agents, he fails to find one that really knows his stuff and is able to work with multiple carriers. Tom finally, via the internet, discovers an Insurance Agency licensed in multiple states, including California, that really seems able to review their situation.\\nThe very first thing that the Insurance Agent, Eon from the Internet firm, asks after carefully reviewing their case is: Are either of their Term Life Insurance policies convertible? Tom has no idea what he is asking and asks him to repeat the question and then explain. Impressed they end their discussion, with Tom going out to explore if indeed either of their term life policies have this option.\\nTom calls Eon the life agent back to tell him that none of their term life policies are convertible. Eon assures him, that its OK, that he can get either or both of them – a small whole life policy with an A rated participating carrier. Tom inquires about the value of the credit rating and Eon insists that its more important with whole life than it is with term life. Tom then stops Eon to tell him that he would like a large whole life policy, something in excess of One Million US Dollars. Eon, states that he will happily show him the numbers for a range of options, but suggests that they look at smaller options as well.\\nThe internet insurance agent also spends a few minutes to politely educate Tom in his ideas of asset protection which was one of the original fundamental reasons that Tom had sought out Whole Life. Eon, the internet agent shares with him that asset protection is \"extremely state specific\" and that California does not have terrific bankruptcy asset protection. He suggests that he engage an attorney in a detailed discussion, but emails him a website that lists some basics about California whole life \"cash value\" creditor protection.\\nNext Eon and Tom discuss Tom\\'s health, his activities, profession, and numerous other underwriting criteria. With the phone call getting to be over an hour long they stop short of reviewing Jenny\\'s health and underwriting information. Tom later regrets this.\\nEon, presents to both Tom and Jenny various whole life insurance options with A and A+ rated participating whole life carriers. He insists that they both understand the difference between the guaranteed and assumed value charts. The assumed value chart use numbers that are less than the past dividend rates.\\nHe thoroughly explains why clients of his pretty much only purchase whole life insurance, in this type situation, with participating carriers. How participating carriers are owned by their insureds and the use of the dividends. Tom is now fully at home with all of the reading and speaking about whole life and assists in explaining some of the finer points to Jenny.\\nEon, also brings up a \"Waiver of Premium Rider\" and explains its value if the insured is unable to work. Being a doctor, Tom immediately smiles and is turned off by the idea not liking insurance companies definition of disability. Eon, the internet agent engages Tom, the Doctor and assures him that there are many definitions used for disability and that he might be able to find a definition that he can live with.\\nThe presentation goes pretty well, but the cost of the Two Million and even One Million dollars plans shock Jenny and slightly surprise Tom. Both of them, were surprised how much more it costs than level term life insurance. Tom, quickly remember that the internet insurance agent had suggested the $500K option as a \"smaller plan\" and is glad that his proposal include this option. Eon has proposals for both of them and he states that since they have not had the opportunity to discuss Jenny\\'s underwriting the price estimates are really not that accurate.\\nThat being said, Jenny\\'s yearly costs seem lower, partially based on the fact that she is a woman (generally women live longer), and and possibly based on the lack of negative information about her health history since they have not discussed it. The presentation ends on a high note, with both Tom and Jenny feeling confident in having found a knowledgeable agent that has conducted a full needs based analysis on their situation.\\nJenny first remarks to Tom, that she thinks its too expensive and that she doesn\\'t understand why they would want insurance once the kids are out of the house and they retire. Tom, who is usually not the safe investor in the house knows that Jenny loves safe investments so he uses this persuasively in his argument about the ability to put a small amount of money in a whole life policy that will easily be affordable for them, even during retirement. Jenny, not fully agreeing, at least agrees that $500K is the most she is interested in. They both wonder about the suitability to insure Tom vs Jenny vs both of them. Jenny is appalled about the thought of both of them buying a whole life policy. For internal political reasons, Tom thinks they he will press forward with the smaller whole life policy for just himself. Jenny thinks they should invest more in the market in safe mutual funds and stocks such as some of the options she saw last night on CNBC, such as Utility stocks which tend to pay out safe dividends.\\nAlthough the girls are getting older, in a couple of years the younger daughter will be done with preschool and be enrolled at the local elementary school cutting their costs a bit. They still have about, on average $35K per year in excess investment money in which to use. On occasional years it can balloon depending on bonuses of the two workers to something much higher. When they are done fully investing in their youngest daughters 529 plan though it will mean a possible additional $24K per year needing an investment home. After speaking with Jenny he is concerned about one of the objections she brought up and that this only makes sense if they are both able to keep working and continue to make the same amount of money. If one of them were to lose their jobs or their businesses became unprofitable the whole life option might weight on them like an unwelcome anchor.\\nTom thinks long and hard about what a non working situation could look like. He is not alarmed by it, but it is concerning. Perhaps he should just drop this.\\nNot liking computers Tom, sits down with Pen and Paper to review his options with the proposed whole life policy. At $7K per year it would be one of their biggest yearly expenses after property taxes on two properties and mortgage payments. Perhaps he can abandon his term life policy? No, that does not make sense. At $7K per year, 30 years of payments will amount of $210K in total. Not the end of the policy but a good chunk of it. And he already has more than $210K set aside, so even if he losses his job…somehow, he could still afford to make the life insurance premium payment, right? Wait, how would he make the mortgage payment? The Property Tax payment? The last think in the world he is going to want to do with his money is pay for a forced savings plan. But wait, his wife works.\\nIt would really only be a major issue if they BOTH lost their jobs, at the same time. She is a partner at a law firm and he owns his own business, is this possible? Tom gets up from his self discussion convinced that it would require a black swan event to make this a reality and he believes these types of swans can not be prepared for.\\nHe does get a chuckle out of imagining buying this product on a much lower income as a few of his younger and less successful neighbors have done. He wonders how they really pull it off. Do they ignore their 401K? Not make extra mortgage payments? Skip the college savings plan? Seven Thousand Dollars per year, for life, for whole life insurance! Wow that just sounds like a lot he thinks.\\nTom knows that Jenny keeps accurate spreadsheets for her assets, so he sits down to do what she would do. He creates columns, adds rows and numerically himself researches how this policy would look with the help of the whole life guaranteed and assumed value charts. He compares returns both taxable and untaxable in his spreadsheet with those of the life insurance companies.\\nAfter Jenny returns from a business trip and over wine they sit down during the fifteen minutes they have free to review what Tom wants to do. Jenny says that she is OK with him moving forward on the $500K front but is just too financially concerned abut anything larger than this. She also admits that if were not for his dogged determination, she probably would never have followed through with the purchase. Tom tells Jenny his concerns about lower earning people buying whole life and Jenny remarks that that is a really good point. \"I don\\'t know how others do it\" She says. Tom chuckles knowing his wife knows the finances better than he does and if she is OK with it, than it probably is the best decision.\\nJenny and Tom obviously have their financial act together. They do not represent the average American family. Yet even in their situation the decision to purchase and fund for the rest of their lives a whole life insurance policy is really not easy.\\nAdd in an excess of $100,000 per year, each and every year, to new savings.\\nBoth of them work. Both working could serve as an odd form of disability self insurance for each other.\\nThey keep spreadsheets and records.\\nThey talk about the finances.\\nThey are paying down their homes with extra payments, adding to retirement and college saving plans.\\nThey do a lot of homework, meet with numerous experts to find just the right product.\\nThey have spent dozens of hours, maybe fifty hours researching Whole Life and its Options.\\nAre the Wangs correct to assume that their proposed whole life insurance policy might protect their assets in the case of something happening with their business? Perhaps, asset protection and bankruptcy laws are very state specific, these clients happen to live in California. And According to California law Whole Life Insurance Asset protection is somewhat limited. Clients are advised to always speak with a lawyer in their state when considering this.\\nThe point to all of this is that these make believe people, The Wangs, are NOT average Americans. They make a ton of money! They have save like the Millionaires Next Door. They are not middle class workers. They took years to carefully make their decision. For most people that do not fit this profile… Term Life Insurance is more than likely the way to go. Yes, there are some exceptions to that rule, for example families that need a Special Needs Trust, but in general Term is the best Option.\\nShould you have questions or not understand something, please feel free to contact us directly at sales@marindependent.com. Whereas Term Life Insurance is simple and inexpensive, Whole Life is complex and complicated. It is really in your best interest to do your own homework on the subject of life insurance. Please see our disclosures. Thank you for reading An Affluent Family Considers Whole Life Insurance.\\nThe above example about an Affluent Family Considers Whole Life Insurance is fiction. Any similarities between actual people is purely confidential. Names and Insurance Company names are fictional. Why is it fiction? Well, first off, it would be very hard to get clients to allow an insurance agency to use their exact financial information. Second, its not practical. Third, I wanted to illustrate a potential client that I believe, barely qualifies to make a whole life policy make sense.\\nThis entry was posted in Life Insurance Story, Whole Life Insurance.
