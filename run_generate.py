The world is at peace under the celestial blanket.\nThe waves crash against the shore. The seagulls soar overhead. The sand is warm beneath my feet. I breathe in the salty air. The ocean's embrace is calming.\nThe leaves rustle in the wind. The birds chirp their melodies. The squirrels scamper up the trees. Nature's symphony plays on. Life thrives in the forest.\nThe city bustles with energy. The skyscrapers touch the clouds. The streets are alive with people. Horns honk and engines roar.

The ocean's embrace is calming.\nThe leaves rustle in the wind. The birds chirp their melodies. The squirrels scamper up the trees. Nature's symphony plays on. Life thrives in the forest.\nThe city bustles with energy. The skyscrapers touch the clouds. The streets are alive with people. Horns honk and engines roar. The urban jungle never sleeps.\nThe mountains stand tall and proud. The snow caps their peaks. The valleys are lush and green. Hikers traverse the trails.

Life thrives in the forest.\nThe city bustles with energy. The skyscrapers touch the clouds. The streets are alive with people. Horns honk and engines roar. The urban jungle never sleeps.\nThe mountains stand tall and proud. The snow caps their peaks. The valleys are lush and green. Hikers traverse the trails. Adventure awaits in the wilderness.\nThe stars twinkle in the night sky. The moon casts its gentle glow. The crickets sing their lullabies. Fireflies dance in the darkness.

Adventure awaits in the wilderness.\nThe stars twinkle in the night sky. The moon casts its gentle glow. The crickets sing their lullabies. Fireflies dance in the darkness. The world is at peace under the celestial blanket.\nThe waves crash against the shore. The seagulls soar overhead. The sand is warm beneath my feet. I breathe in the salty air. The ocean's embrace is calming.\nThe leaves rustle in the wind. The birds chirp their melodies. The squirrels scamper up the trees. Nature's symphony plays on.

The world is at peace under the celestial blanket.\nThe waves crash against the shore. The seagulls soar overhead. The sand is warm beneath my feet. I breathe in the salty air. The ocean's embrace is calming.\nThe leaves rustle in the wind. The birds chirp their melodies. The squirrels scamper up the trees. Nature's symphony plays on. Life thrives in the forest.\nThe city bustles with energy. The skyscrapers touch the clouds. The streets are alive with people. Horns honk and engines roar.

The ocean's embrace is calming.\nThe leaves rustle in the wind. The birds chirp their melodies. The squirrels scamper up the trees. Nature's symphony plays on. Life thrives in the forest.\nThe city bustles with energy. The skyscrapers touch the clouds. The streets are alive with people. Horns honk and engines roar. The urban jungle never sleeps.\nThe mountains stand tall and proud. The snow caps their peaks. The valleys are lush and green. Hikers traverse the trails.

Sometimes, even something as seemingly mundane as managing office equipment can have a significant impact on healthcare providers' operations and bottom line. This is where managed print services come into play, providing solutions that help medical organizations streamline their printing processes while reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Let's take a closer look at how Vein Clinics of America benefited from implementing managed print services by using the extract provided as our starting point.

First, let's understand what Vein Clinics of America does - they specialize in treating various venous disorders such as varicose veins, spider veins, and leg ulcers across multiple clinics nationwide. With so many locations and employees, effective communication becomes crucial. Having reliable printing infrastructure plays an essential role in ensuring smooth internal workflows and patient care.

Before transitioning to managed print services, Vein Clinics faced several challenges related to their printer management. These issues include relying on local dealers for copiers, having excess inventory at every clinic, and buying new replacements whenever printers malfunctioned instead of repairing them. Such practices led to unnecessary expenses and inefficiencies.

Now imagine if similar problems existed within larger hospital systems or research institutions. Mismanagement of print resources could lead to substantial financial losses and hinder important scientific advancements due to preventable operational hurdles.

When Vein Clinics decided to partner with a managed print provider, they gained access to more strategic and cost-effective solutions tailored specifically to their unique requirements. By recommending keeping existing assets functioning rather than replacing them prematurely, the managed print provider helped extend the lifespan of the devices and lower capital expenditures. Moreover, focusing on servicing rather than merely selling hardware allowed for quicker resolution times when issues did arise.

Additionally, introducing a hardware assurance guarantee ensured maximum uptime, minimizing disruptions to daily activities. Finally, the flexible agreement enabled Vein Clinics to scale its printing capabilities according to changing demands seamlessly.

The benefits experienced by Vein Clinics offer insights into how managed print services can revolutionize print management within the broader scope of medicine. Some key takeaways include:

1. Cost savings: Managed print services help reduce overall spending through optimized device utilization, efficient consumables management, and proactive maintenance.
2. Improved productivity: Quick response times to service requests and regular updates mean less downtime and increased employee output.
3. Scalability: Flexible agreements allow healthcare providers to adjust their printing capacity based on growth trajectories or fluctuations in demand.
4. Environmental sustainability: Efficient resource allocation leads to reduced waste generation, contributing positively towards environmental goals.
5. Focus on core competencies: Outsourcing print management enables healthcare professionals to concentrate on delivering quality care without worrying about peripheral tasks.

In conclusion, adopting managed print services offers numerous advantages beyond mere cost reduction. It allows healthcare providers to streamline their operations, enhance productivity, promote sustainability, and ultimately improve focus on patient care. Whether you're running a small chain of clinics or managing a large hospital network, embracing smart print management strategies can make a considerable difference in your organization's success.<|endoftext|> Title: The New Polymer Banknote and the Future of Cryptocurrency: Is There a Intersection?

Hello there, savvy readers! Today we'll be discussing the recent release of the new £20 polymer banknote by the Bank of England and how it relates to the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. So let's dive right in!

On February 20th, 2020, the Bank of England introduced its latest addition to the British currency family - the new polymer £20 note featuring the prominent artist J.M.W Turner. While this may seem unrelated to digital currencies at first glance, it raises some fascinating questions about the future of money and transactions. Will physical cash become obsolete as more people turn towards cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple etc., or will it continue to coexist alongside them? Let us explore further!

Firstly, what makes these new polymer notes so special? Well, they are designed to last longer than traditional paper bills while also being harder to counterfeit due to advanced security features. This could potentially extend the lifespan of physical cash, thereby slowing down the transition to fully digital finance systems. However, even with improved durability, many experts believe that cash might eventually phase out completely – but when exactly would that happen? And what implications does this have for crypto enthusiasts?

Interestingly enough, cryptocurrencies can learn quite a bit from these new polymer notes. For instance, one common criticism against digital coins is their susceptibility to hacking and cyber theft. By incorporating cutting-edge encryption methods used in blockchain technology, virtual currencies could enhance user protection and foster greater trust among potential investors. Additionally, just like how the BoE implemented public engagement campaigns during the rollout process of the new £20 note, crypto platforms need to ensure clear communication channels to address any concerns or misconceptions held by users.

Another point worth noting is central banks' growing interest in creating their own digital currencies. Sweden's Riksbank and China's People's Bank of China are already exploring possibilities in this area. These Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), if successful, could provide stiff competition to decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin and Ether. After all, who wouldn't prefer using a state-backed digital coin over ones plagued by volatility issues?

However, despite CBDCs posing challenges for cryptos, they also present opportunities for collaboration. With both relying on distributed ledger technologies, merging forces could result in stronger financial networks capable of handling large volumes of transactions efficiently and securely. Imagine transferring funds across borders seamlessly without worrying about conversion rates or hidden fees! Sounds promising, doesn't it?

In conclusion, although the launch of the new polymer £20 note may appear detached from the realm of cryptocurrencies, it serves as a reminder of how innovation drives evolution in our monetary systems. Whether you're pro-cash, pro-crypto, or somewhere in between, understanding the dynamics shaping each sphere allows us to better navigate this exciting landscape of endless possibilities.

Remember, change is inevitable, especially in something as dynamic as currency. Embrace it, adapt to it, and keep learning because knowledge empowers us to make informed decisions about our financial futures. Until next time, stay curious and informed!<|endoftext|> Title: Navigating Student Enquiries: A Key Component of Real Estate & Investment Education

Introduction

As a prospective or current real estate investor, education plays a crucial role in shaping your success. One essential aspect of this learning journey involves seeking assistance to manage various student enquiries effectively. Whether it's clarifying concepts through frequently asked questions (FAQs), submitting specific queries via online forms, or connecting directly with support staff, these channels enable students to access vital resources efficiently. Let's explore how each method contributes to enhancing your understanding of real estate investment principles while fostering a sense of community among learners.

The Power of FAQs: Harnessing Collective Wisdom

Imagine being able to tap into the collective knowledge of fellow students who have already encountered similar challenges as you embark on your real estate investment studies. That's precisely what FAQ sections offer! These repositories contain answers to common questions posed by previous learners, allowing you to glean insights from their experiences and potentially save time searching for solutions independently. By perusing through carefully curated FAQs, you can quickly grasp key concepts related to property valuation, market trends, financing options, and risk management strategies. Moreover, regularly updated FAQs ensure that the content remains relevant and responsive to evolving industry dynamics.

Online Enquiry Forms: Tailored Assistance at Your Fingertips

Sometimes, your unique situation may not align perfectly with general FAQ entries. This is where customized online enquiry forms shine! By submitting a detailed description of your concern, you provide subject matter experts with sufficient context to craft targeted responses tailored specifically to your needs. As such, this approach often yields more precise and comprehensive solutions than broad searches might yield. Additionally, tracking past interactions within your account facilitates continuity in communication, enabling both parties to reference prior exchanges effortlessly. Over time, building rapport with dedicated support teams can significantly enhance your overall educational experience, particularly when navigating intricate topics like taxation implications, legal considerations, or portfolio diversification tactics.

Phone Support: The Human Touch in Digital Learning

Despite rapid advancements in technology, there remains no substitute for human connection—especially during challenging moments in one's academic journey. Speaking directly with a representative provides immediate reassurance, addressing any lingering doubts or concerns that haven't been adequately addressed through other channels. Furthermore, telephone conversations allow for spontaneous dialogue, prompting follow-up questions or alternative viewpoints that might otherwise go unexplored in written correspondence. While waiting times and availability may vary depending on demand, having access to expert advice during regular business hours helps maintain momentum in your studies, ultimately contributing to long-term retention and proficiency in real estate investment practices.

ID Cards & Official Documents: Streamlined Verifications for Accreditation

Lastly, obtaining verifiable credentials is paramount for demonstrating competence within the competitive realm of real estate investing. Securing physical or digital ID cards and certificates serves as

This problem requires knowledge of complex numbers and algebraic manipulations. We will break down the solution into smaller steps and explain the underlying mathematical principles. Complex numbers can be represented as ordered pairs (a, b) or in the form of a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the square root of -1. When squaring i, you get (-1). Let's examine the given expression more closely: (n + i)^4 = n^4 + 4in³ - 6n² - 4in + 1 For this expression to result in an integer value, both its real and imaginary components must equal integers. First, let us focus on the imaginary part of the expression: 4in³ - 4in. For these terms to cancel out when adding the whole expression, they need to be equivalent; hence: 4in³ - 4in = 0 Now, factor out 4in: 4in(n² - 1) = 0 The equation above implies two possible scenarios.

\section*{Chapter 6}
\section*{Fitting models}
Chapters 3 and 4 described shallow and deep neural networks. These represent families of piecewise linear functions, where the parameters determine the particular function. Chapter 5 introduced the loss - a single number representing the mismatch between the network predictions and the ground truth for a training set.

The loss depends on the network parameters, and this chapter considers how to find the parameter values that minimize this loss. This is known as learning the network's parameters or simply as training or fitting the model. The process is to choose initial parameter values and then iterate the following two steps: (i) compute the derivatives (gradients) of the loss with respect to the parameters, and (ii) adjust the parameters based on the gradients to decrease the loss. After many iterations, we hope to reach the overall minimum of the loss function.

This chapter tackles the second of these steps; we consider algorithms that adjust the parameters to decrease the loss. Chapter 7 discusses how to initialize the parameters and compute the gradients for neural networks.

\subsection*{6.1 Gradient descent}
To fit a model, we need a training set $\left\{\mathbf{x}_{i}, \mathbf{y}_{i}\right\}$ of input/output pairs. We seek parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ for the model $\mathbf{f}\left[\mathbf{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{\phi}\right]$ that map the inputs $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ to the outputs $\mathbf{y}_{i}$ as well as possible. To this end, we define a loss function $\mathrm{L}[\boldsymbol{\phi}]$ that returns a single number that quantifies the mismatch in this mapping. The goal of an optimization algorithm is to find parameters $\hat{\phi}$ that minimize the loss:


\begin{equation*}
\hat{\phi}=\underset{\phi}{\operatorname{argmin}}[\mathrm{L}[\phi]] \tag{6.1}
\end{equation*}


There are many families of optimization algorithms, but the standard methods for training neural networks are iterative. These algorithms initialize the parameters heuristically and then adjust them repeatedly in such a way that the loss decreases.

The simplest method in this class is gradient descent. This starts with initial parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}=\left[\phi_{0}, \phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{N}\right]^{T}$ and iterates two steps:

Step 1. Compute the derivatives of the loss with respect to the parameters:

\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi}=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_{0}}  \tag{6.2}\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_{1}} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi_{N}}
\end{array}\right]
\]

Step 2. Update the parameters according to the rule:


\begin{equation*}
\phi \longleftarrow \phi-\alpha \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} \tag{6.3}
\end{equation*}


where the positive scalar $\alpha$ determines the magnitude of the change.

The first step computes the gradient of the loss function at the current position. This determines the uphill direction of the loss function. The second step moves a small distance $\alpha$ downhill (hence the negative sign). The parameter $\alpha$ may be fixed (in which case, we call it a learning rate), or we may perform a line search where we try several values of $\alpha$ to find the one that most decreases the loss.

At the minimum of the loss function, the surface must be flat (or we could improve further by going downhill). Hence, the gradient will be zero, and the parameters will stop changing. In practice, we monitor the gradient magnitude and terminate the algorithm when it becomes too small.

\subsection*{6.1.1 Linear regression example}
Consider applying gradient descent to the 1D linear regression model from chapter 2. The model $\mathrm{f}[x, \phi]$ maps a scalar input $x$ to a scalar output $y$ and has parameters $\phi=\left[\phi_{0}, \phi_{1}\right]^{T}$, which represent the $\mathrm{y}$-intercept and the slope:


\begin{align*}
y & =\mathrm{f}[x, \boldsymbol{\phi}] \\
& =\phi_{0}+\phi_{1} x . \tag{6.4}
\end{align*}


Given a dataset $\left\{x_{i}, y_{i}\right\}$ containing $I$ input/output pairs, we choose the least squares loss function:


\begin{align*}
\mathrm{L}[\phi]=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \ell_{i} & =\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left(\mathrm{f}\left[x_{i}, \phi\right]-y_{i}\right)^{2} \\
& =\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left(\phi_{0}+\phi_{1} x_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2} \tag{6.5}
\end{align*}

Figure 6.1 Gradient descent for the linear regression model. a) Training set of $I=$ 12 input/output pairs $\left\{x_{i}, y_{i}\right\}$. b) Loss function showing iterations of gradient descent. We start at point 0 and move in the steepest downhill direction until we can improve no further to arrive at point 1. We then repeat this procedure. We measure the gradient at point 1 and move downhill to point 2 and so on. c) This can be visualized better as a heatmap, where the brightness represents the loss. After only four iterations, we are already close to the minimum. d) The model with the parameters at point 0 (lightest line) describes the data very badly, but each successive iteration improves the fit. The model with the parameters at point 4 (darkest line) is already a reasonable description of the training data.\\
where the term $\ell_{i}=\left(\phi_{0}+\phi_{1} x_{i}-y_{i}\right)^{2}$ is the individual contribution to the loss from the $i^{\text {th }}$ training example.

The derivative of the loss function with respect to the parameters can be decomposed into the sum of the derivatives of the individual contributions:


\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi}=\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \ell_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{\partial \ell_{i}}{\partial \phi} \tag{6.6}
\end{equation*}

Notebook 6.2 Gradient descent

where these are given by:

\[
\frac{\partial \ell_{i}}{\partial \phi}=\left[\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\partial \ell_{i}}{\partial \phi_{0}}  \tag{6.7}\\
\frac{\partial \ell_{i}}{\partial \phi_{1}}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
2\left(\phi_{0}+\phi_{1} x_{i}-y_{i}\right) \\
2 x_{i}\left(\phi_{0}+\phi_{1} x_{i}-y_{i}\right)
\end{array}\right]
\]

Figure 6.1 shows the progression of this algorithm as we iteratively compute the derivatives according to equations 6.6 and 6.7 and then update the parameters using the rule in equation 6.3. In this case, we have used a line search procedure to find the value of $\alpha$ that decreases the loss the most at each iteration.

\subsection*{6.1.2 Gabor model example}
Problem 6.2

Problems 6.3-6.5

Loss functions for linear regression problems (figure 6.1c) always have a single welldefined global minimum. More formally, they are convex, which means that no chord (line segment between two points on the surface) intersects the function. Convexity implies that wherever we initialize the parameters, we are bound to reach the minimum if we keep walking downhill; the training procedure can't fail.

Unfortunately, loss functions for most nonlinear models, including both shallow and deep networks, are non-convex. Visualizing neural network loss functions is challenging due to the number of parameters. Hence, we first explore a simpler nonlinear model with two parameters to gain insight into the properties of non-convex loss functions:


\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{f}[x, \boldsymbol{\phi}]=\sin \left[\phi_{0}+0.06 \cdot \phi_{1} x\right] \cdot \exp \left(-\frac{\left(\phi_{0}+0.06 \cdot \phi_{1} x\right)^{2}}{32.0}\right) \tag{6.8}
\end{equation*}


This Gabor model maps scalar input $x$ to scalar output $y$ and consists of a sinusoidal component (creating an oscillatory function) multiplied by a negative exponential component (causing the amplitude to decrease as we move from the center). It has two parameters $\boldsymbol{\phi}=\left[\phi_{0}, \phi_{1}\right]^{T}$, where $\phi_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$ determines the mean position of the function and $\phi_{1} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$stretches or squeezes it along the $x$-axis (figure 6.2).

Consider a training set of $I$ examples $\left\{x_{i}, y_{i}\right\}$ (figure 6.3). The least squares loss function for $I$ training examples is defined as:


\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{L}[\boldsymbol{\phi}]=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\left(\mathrm{f}\left[x_{i}, \boldsymbol{\phi}\right]-y_{i}\right)^{2} \tag{6.9}
\end{equation*}


Once more, the goal is to find the parameters $\hat{\phi}$ that minimize this loss.

Figure 6.2 Gabor model. This nonlinear model maps scalar input $x$ to scalar output $y$ and has parameters $\phi=\left[\phi_{0}, \phi_{1}\right]^{T}$. It describes a sinusoidal function that decreases in amplitude with distance from its center. Parameter $\phi_{0} \in \mathbb{R}$ determines the position of the center. As $\phi_{0}$ increases, the function moves left. Parameter $\phi_{1} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$squeezes the function along the $x$-axis relative to the center. As $\phi_{1}$ increases, the function narrows. a-c) Model with different parameters.

Figure 6.3 Training data for fitting the Gabor model. The training dataset contains 28 input/output examples $\left\{x_{i}, y_{i}\right\}$. These data were created by uniformly sampling $x_{i} \in[-15,15]$, passing the samples through a Gabor model with parameters $\phi=[0.0,16.6]^{T}$, and adding normally distributed noise.

\subsection*{6.1.3 Local minima and saddle points}
Figure 6.4 depicts the loss function associated with the Gabor model for this dataset. There are numerous local minima (cyan circles). Here the gradient is zero, and the loss increases if we move in any direction, but we are not at the overall minimum of the function. The point with the lowest loss is known as the global minimum and is depicted by the gray circle.

If we start in a random position and use gradient descent to go downhill, there is no guarantee that we will wind up at the global minimum and find the best parameters (figure 6.5a). It's equally or even more likely that the algorithm will terminate in one of the local minima. Furthermore, there is no way of knowing whether there is a better solution elsewhere.

It also contains saddle points where the gradient is locally zero, but the function increases in one direction and decreases in the other. The blue cross is an example of a saddle point; the function decreases as we move horizontally in either direction but increases as we move vertically. b-f) Models associated with the different minima. In each case, there is no small change that decreases the loss. Panel (c) shows the global minimum, which has a loss of 0.64.

\end{center}

Figure 6.5 Gradient descent vs. stochastic gradient descent. a) Gradient descent with line search. As long as the gradient descent algorithm is initialized in the right "valley" of the loss function (e.g., points 1 and 3), the parameter estimate will move steadily toward the global minimum. However, if it is initialized outside this valley (e.g., point 2), it will descend toward one of the local minima. b) Stochastic gradient descent adds noise to the optimization process, so it is possible to escape from the wrong valley (e.g., point 2) and still reach the global minimum.

In addition, the loss function contains saddle points (e.g., the blue cross in figure 6.4). Here, the gradient is zero, but the function increases in some directions and decreases in others. If the current parameters are not exactly at the saddle point, then gradient descent can escape by moving downhill. However, the surface near the saddle point is flat, so it's hard to be sure that training hasn't converged; if we terminate the algorithm when the gradient is small, we may erroneously stop near a saddle point.

\subsection*{6.2 Stochastic gradient descent}
The Gabor model has two parameters, so we could find the global minimum by either (i) exhaustively searching the parameter space or (ii) repeatedly starting gradient descent from different positions and choosing the result with the lowest loss. However, neural network models can have millions of parameters, so neither approach is practical. In short, using gradient descent to find the global optimum of a high-dimensional loss function is challenging. We can find $a$ minimum, but there is no way to tell whether this

Figure 6.6 Alternative view of SGD for the Gabor model with a batch size of three. a) Loss function for the entire training dataset. At each iteration, there is a probability distribution of possible parameter changes (inset shows samples). These correspond to different choices of the three batch elements. b) Loss function for one possible batch. The SGD algorithm moves in the downhill direction on this function for a distance that is determined by the learning rate and the local gradient magnitude. The current model (dashed function in inset) changes to better fit the batch data (solid function). c) A different batch creates a different loss function and results in a different update. d) For this batch, the algorithm moves downhill with respect to the batch loss function but uphill with respect to the global loss function in panel (a).

is the global minimum or even a good one.

One of the main problems is that the final destination of a gradient descent algorithm is entirely determined by the starting point. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) attempts to remedy this problem by adding some noise to the gradient at each step. The solution

gradient descent

still moves downhill on average, but at any given iteration, the direction chosen is not necessarily in the steepest downhill direction. Indeed, it might not be downhill at all. The SGD algorithm has the possibility of moving temporarily uphill and hence jumping from one "valley" of the loss function to another (figure 6.5b).

\subsection*{6.2.1 Batches and epochs}
The mechanism for introducing randomness is simple. At each iteration, the algorithm chooses a random subset of the training data and computes the gradient from these examples alone. This subset is known as a minibatch or batch for short. The update rule for the model parameters $\phi_{t}$ at iteration $t$ is hence:


\begin{equation*}
\phi_{t+1} \longleftarrow \phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}_{t}} \frac{\partial \ell_{i}\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi} \tag{6.10}
\end{equation*}


where $\mathcal{B}_{t}$ is a set containing the indices of the input/output pairs in the current batch and, as before, $\ell_{i}$ is the loss due to the $i^{\text {th }}$ pair. The term $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and together with the gradient magnitude, determines the distance moved at each iteration. The learning rate is chosen at the start of the procedure and does not depend on the local properties of the function.

The batches are usually drawn from the dataset without replacement. The algorithm works through the training examples until it has used all the data, at which point it starts sampling from the full training dataset again. A single pass through the entire training dataset is referred to as an epoch. A batch may be as small as a single example or as large as the whole dataset. The latter case is called full-batch gradient descent and is identical to regular (non-stochastic) gradient descent.

An alternative interpretation of SGD is that it computes the gradient of a different loss function at each iteration; the loss function depends on both the model and the training data and hence will differ for each randomly selected batch. In this view, SGD performs deterministic gradient descent on a constantly changing loss function (figure 6.6). However, despite this variability, the expected loss and expected gradients at any point remain the same as for gradient descent.

\subsection*{6.2.2 Properties of stochastic gradient descent}
SGD has several attractive features. First, although it adds noise to the trajectory, it still improves the fit to a subset of the data at each iteration. Hence, the updates tend to be sensible even if they are not optimal. Second, because it draws training examples without replacement and iterates through the dataset, the training examples all still contribute equally. Third, it is less computationally expensive to compute the gradient\\
from just a subset of the training data. Fourth, it can (in principle) escape local minima. Fifth, it reduces the chances of getting stuck near saddle points; it is likely that at least some of the possible batches will have a significant gradient at any point on the loss function. Finally, there is some evidence that SGD finds parameters for neural networks that cause them to generalize well to new data in practice (see section 9.2).

SGD does not necessarily "converge" in the traditional sense. However, the hope is that when we are close to the global minimum, all the data points will be well described by the model. Consequently, the gradient will be small, whichever batch is chosen, and the parameters will cease to change much. In practice, SGD is often applied with a learning rate schedule. The learning rate $\alpha$ starts at a high value and is decreased by a constant factor every $N$ epochs. The logic is that in the early stages of training, we want the algorithm to explore the parameter space, jumping from valley to valley to find a sensible region. In later stages, we are roughly in the right place and are more concerned with fine-tuning the parameters, so we decrease $\alpha$ to make smaller changes.

\subsection*{6.3 Momentum}
A common modification to stochastic gradient descent is to add a momentum term. We update the parameters with a weighted combination of the gradient computed from the current batch and the direction moved in the previous step:


\begin{align*}
\mathbf{m}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \beta \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t}+(1-\beta) \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}_{t}} \frac{\partial \ell_{i}\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi} \\
\boldsymbol{\phi}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t+1} \tag{6.11}
\end{align*}


where $\mathbf{m}_{t}$ is the momentum (which drives the update at iteration $t$ ), $\beta \in[0,1$ ) controls the degree to which the gradient is smoothed over time, and $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

The recursive formulation of the momentum calculation means that the gradient step is an infinite weighted sum of all the previous gradients, where the weights get smaller as we move back in time. The effective learning rate increases if all these gradients are aligned over multiple iterations but decreases if the gradient direction repeatedly changes as the terms in the sum cancel out. The overall effect is a smoother trajectory and reduced oscillatory behavior in valleys (figure 6.7).

\subsection*{6.3.1 Nesterov accelerated momentum}
The momentum term can be considered a coarse prediction of where the SGD algorithm will move next. Nesterov accelerated momentum (figure 6.8) computes the gradients at this predicted point rather than at the current point:\\

\end{center}

Figure 6.7 Stochastic gradient descent with momentum. a) Regular stochastic descent takes a very indirect path toward the minimum. b) With a momentum term, the change at the current step is a weighted combination of the previous change and the gradient computed from the batch. This smooths out the trajectory and increases the speed of convergence.

\end{center}

Figure 6.8 Nesterov accelerated momentum. The solution has traveled along the dashed line to arrive at point 1. A traditional momentum update measures the gradient at point 1 , moves some distance in this direction to point 2 , and then adds the momentum term from the previous iteration (i.e., in the same direction as the dashed line), arriving at point 3. The Nesterov momentum update first applies the momentum term (moving from point 1 to point 4) and then measures the gradient and applies an update to arrive at point 5 .


\begin{align*}
\mathbf{m}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \beta \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t}+(1-\beta) \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}_{t}} \frac{\partial \ell_{i}\left[\phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi} \\
\boldsymbol{\phi}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t+1} \tag{6.12}
\end{align*}


where now the gradients are evaluated at $\phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t}$. One way to think about this is that the gradient term now corrects the path provided by momentum alone.

\subsection*{6.4 Adam}
Gradient descent with a fixed step size has the following undesirable property: it makes large adjustments to parameters associated with large gradients (where perhaps we should be more cautious) and small adjustments to parameters associated with small gradients (where perhaps we should explore further). When the gradient of the loss surface is much steeper in one direction than another, it is difficult to choose a learning rate that (i) makes good progress in both directions and (ii) is stable (figures 6.9a-b).

A straightforward approach is to normalize the gradients so that we move a fixed distance (governed by the learning rate) in each direction. To do this, we first measure the gradient $\mathbf{m}_{t+1}$ and the pointwise squared gradient $\mathbf{v}_{t+1}$ :


\begin{align*}
\mathbf{m}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \frac{\partial L\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi} \\
\mathbf{v}_{t+1} & \leftarrow\left(\frac{\partial L\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi}\right)^{2} \tag{6.13}
\end{align*}


Then we apply the update rule:

\begin{equation*}
\phi_{t+1} \leftarrow \phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \frac{\mathbf{m}_{t+1}}{\sqrt{\mathbf{v}_{t+1}}+\epsilon} \tag{6.14}
\end{equation*}


where the square root and division are both pointwise, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant that prevents division by zero when the gradient magnitude is zero. The term $\mathbf{v}_{t+1}$ is the squared gradient, and the positive root of this is used to normalize the gradient itself, so all that remains is the sign in each coordinate direction. The result is that the algorithm moves a fixed distance $\alpha$ along each coordinate, where the direction is determined by whichever way is downhill (figure 6.9c). This simple algorithm makes good progress in both directions but will not converge unless it happens to land exactly at the minimum. Instead, it will bounce back and forth around the minimum.

Adaptive moment estimation, or Adam, takes this idea and adds momentum to both the estimate of the gradient and the squared gradient:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2024_06_29_7fe01c91dbeda2a79c9dg-103}
\end{center}

Figure 6.9 Adaptive moment estimation (Adam). a) This loss function changes quickly in the vertical direction but slowly in the horizontal direction. If we run full-batch gradient descent with a learning rate that makes good progress in the vertical direction, then the algorithm takes a long time to reach the final horizontal position. b) If the learning rate is chosen so that the algorithm makes good progress in the horizontal direction, it overshoots in the vertical direction and becomes unstable. c) A straightforward approach is to move a fixed distance along each axis at each step so that we move downhill in both directions. This is accomplished by normalizing the gradient magnitude and retaining only the sign. However, this does not usually converge to the exact minimum but instead oscillates back and forth around it (here between the last two points). d) The Adam algorithm uses momentum in both the estimated gradient and the normalization term, which creates a smoother path.


\begin{align*}
\mathbf{m}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \beta \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t}+(1-\beta) \frac{\partial L\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi} \\
\mathbf{v}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \gamma \cdot \mathbf{v}_{t}+(1-\gamma)\left(\frac{\partial L\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi}\right)^{2} \tag{6.15}
\end{align*}


where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the momentum coefficients for the two statistics.

Using momentum is equivalent to taking a weighted average over the history of each of these statistics. At the start of the procedure, all the previous measurements are effectively zero, resulting in unrealistically small estimates. Consequently, we modify these statistics using the rule:


\begin{align*}
\tilde{\mathbf{m}}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \frac{\mathbf{m}_{t+1}}{1-\beta^{t+1}} \\
\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \frac{\mathbf{v}_{t+1}}{1-\gamma^{t+1}} \tag{6.16}
\end{align*}


Since $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are in the range $[0,1)$, the terms with exponents $t+1$ become smaller with each time step, the denominators become closer to one, and this modification has a diminishing effect.

Finally, we update the parameters as before, but with the modified terms:


\begin{equation*}
\phi_{t+1} \leftarrow \phi_{t}-\alpha \cdot \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{m}}_{t+1}}{\sqrt{\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{t+1}}+\epsilon} \tag{6.17}
\end{equation*}


Notebook 6.5

The result is an algorithm that can converge to the overall minimum and makes good progress in every direction in the parameter space. Note that Adam is usually used in a stochastic setting where the gradients and their squares are computed from mini-batches:


\begin{align*}
\mathbf{m}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \beta \cdot \mathbf{m}_{t}+(1-\beta) \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}_{t}} \frac{\partial \ell_{i}\left[\boldsymbol{\phi}_{t}\right]}{\partial \phi} \\
\mathbf{v}_{t+1} & \leftarrow \gamma \cdot \mathbf{v}_{t}+(1-\gamma) \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}_{t}}\left(\frac{\partial \ell_{i}\left[\phi_{t}\right]}{\partial \boldsymbol{\phi}}\right)^{2} \tag{6.18}
\end{align*}


and so the trajectory is noisy in practice.

As we shall see in chapter 7 , the gradient magnitudes of neural network parameters can depend on their depth in the network. Adam helps compensate for this tendency and balances out changes across the different layers. In practice, Adam also has the advantage of being less sensitive to the initial learning rate because it avoids situations like those in figures $6.9 \mathrm{a}-\mathrm{b}$, so it doesn't need complex learning rate schedules.

\subsection*{6.5 Training algorithm hyperparameters}
The choices of learning algorithm, batch size, learning rate schedule, and momentum coefficients are all considered hyperparameters of the training algorithm; these directly affect the final model performance but are distinct from the model parameters. Choosing these can be more art than science, and it's common to train many models with different hyperparameters and choose the best one. This is known as hyperparameter search. We return to this issue in chapter 8 .

\subsection*{6.6 Summary}
This chapter discussed model training. This problem was framed as finding parameters $\phi$ that corresponded to the minimum of a loss function $L[\phi]$. The gradient descent method measures the gradient of the loss function for the current parameters (i.e., how the loss changes when we make a small change to the parameters). Then it moves the parameters in the direction that decreases the loss fastest. This is repeated until convergence.

For nonlinear functions, the loss function may have both local minima (where gradient descent gets trapped) and saddle points (where gradient descent may appear to have converged but has not). Stochastic gradient descent helps mitigate these problems. ${ }^{1}$ At each iteration, we use a different random subset of the data (a batch) to compute the gradient. This adds noise to the process and helps prevent the algorithm from getting trapped in a sub-optimal region of parameter space. Each iteration is also computationally cheaper since it only uses a subset of the data. We saw that adding a momentum term makes convergence more efficient. Finally, we introduced the Adam algorithm.

The ideas in this chapter apply to optimizing any model. The next chapter tackles two aspects of training specific to neural networks. First, we address how to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of a neural network. This is accomplished using the famous backpropagation algorithm. Second, we discuss how to initialize the network parameters before optimization begins. Without careful initialization, the gradients used by the optimization can become extremely large or extremely small, which can hinder the training process.

\section*{Notes}
Optimization algorithms: Optimization algorithms are used extensively throughout engineering, and it is generally more typical to use the term objective function rather than loss function or cost function. Gradient descent was invented by Cauchy (1847), and stochastic gradient descent dates back to at least Robbins \& Monro (1951). A modern compromise between the two is stochastic variance-reduced descent (Johnson \& Zhang, 2013), in which the full gradient is computed periodically, with stochastic updates interspersed. Reviews of optimization algorithms for neural networks can be found in Ruder (2016), Bottou et al. (2018), and Sun (2020). Bottou (2012) discusses best practice for SGD, including shuffling without replacement.
\footnotetext{${ }^{1}$ Chapter 20 discusses the extent to which saddle points and local minima really are problems in deep learning. In practice, deep networks are surprisingly easy to train.
}

Convexity, minima, and saddle points: A function is convex if no chord (line segment between two points on the surface) intersects the function. This can be tested algebraically by considering the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second derivatives):

\[
\mathbf{H}[\boldsymbol{\phi}]=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{0}^{2}} & \frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{0} \partial \phi_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{0} \partial \phi_{N}}  \tag{6.19}\\
\frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{1} \partial \phi_{0}} & \frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{1}^{2}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{1} \partial \phi_{N}} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{N} \partial \phi_{0}} & \frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{N} \partial \phi_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^{2} L}{\partial \phi_{N}^{2}}
\end{array}\right]

The torch.nn namespace provides all the building blocks you need to build your own neural network. Every module in PyTorch subclasses the nn.Module. A neural network is a module itself that consists of other modules (layers). This nested structure allows for building and managing complex architectures easily.

The team had spent months, and about $\$ 10$ million, training DBRX, a large language model similar in design to the one behind OpenAl's ChatGPT. But they wouldn't know how powerful their creation was until results came back from the final tests of its abilities."
