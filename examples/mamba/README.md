## Bug related to nanotron
Encountered the following issue when ran train_mamba.sh:   
```
causal_conv1d_cuda.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZNK3c1017SymbolicShapeMeta18init_is_contiguousEv
```
Solved this by doing:    
pip uninstall mamba-ssm   
pip install causal_conv1d==1.1.1   
pip install mamba-ssm --no-cache-dir
